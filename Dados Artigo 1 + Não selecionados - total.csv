Q#: Enabling Scalable Quantum Computing and Development with a High-level DSL;"Quantum computing exploits quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement to realize a form of parallelism that is not available to traditional computing. It offers the potential of significant computational speed-ups in quantum chemistry, materials science, cryptography, and machine learning.

The dominant approach to programming quantum computers is to provide an existing high-level language with libraries that allow for the expression of quantum programs. This approach can permit computations that are meaningless in a quantum context; prohibits succint expression of interaction between classical and quantum logic; and does not provide important constructs that are required for quantum programming.

We present Q#, a quantum-focused domain-specific language explicitly designed to correctly, clearly and completely express quantum algorithms. Q# provides a type system; a tightly constrained environment to safely interleave classical and quantum computations; specialized syntax; symbolic code manipulation to automatically generate correct transformations of quantum operations; and powerful functional constructs which aid composition.";1
Quipper: A Scalable Quantum Programming Language;The field of quantum algorithms is vibrant. Still, there is currently a lack of programming languages for describing quantum computation on a practical scale, i.e., not just at the level of toy problems. We address this issue by introducing Quipper, a scalable, expressive, functional, higher-order quantum programming language. Quipper has been used to program a diverse set of non-trivial quantum algorithms, and can generate quantum gate representations using trillions of gates. It is geared towards a model of computation that uses a classical computer to control a quantum device, but is not dependent on any particular model of quantum hardware. Quipper has proven effective and easy to use, and opens the door towards using formal methods to analyze quantum algorithms.;1
QuaFL: a typed DSL for quantum programming;"Quantum computers represent a novel kind of programmable hardware with properties and restrictions that are distinct from those of classical computers. We investigate how some existing abstractions and programming language features developed within the programming languages community can be adapted to expose the unique capabilities of quantum computers to programmers while at the same time allowing them to manage the new and unfamiliar constraints of programming a quantum device.

We introduce QuaFL, a statically typed domain-specific programming language for writing high-level definitions of algorithms that can be compiled into logical quantum circuits. The primary purpose of QuaFL is to support programmers in defining high-level yet physically realizable quantum algorithms and in helping them make informed decisions about implementation trade-offs. QuaFL allows programmers to use high-level data structures including integers, fixed point reals, and arrays within quantum algorithms, and to explicitly define superpositions and unitary transformations on data. The QuaFL type system allows programmers to distinguish between classical and quantum portions of a program, uses a variant of linear types and an orthogonality checking algorithm to ensure the quantum portions are physically realizable, and provides type size annotations that can facilitate automated computation of the quantities of quantum resources that will be necessary to run the compiled program (i.e., a logical quantum circuit).";1
QCOR: A Language Extension Specification for the Heterogeneous Quantum-Classical Model of Computation;Quantum computing is an emerging computational paradigm that leverages the laws of quantum mechanics to perform elementary logic operations. Existing programming models for quantum computing were designed with fault-tolerant hardware in mind, envisioning standalone applications. However, near-term quantum computers are susceptible to noise which limits their standalone utility. To better leverage limited computational strengths of noisy quantum devices, hybrid algorithms have been suggested whereby quantum computers are used in tandem with their classical counterparts in a heterogeneous fashion. This {\it modus operandi} calls out for a programming model and a high-level programming language that natively and seamlessly supports heterogeneous quantum-classical hardware architectures in a single-source-code paradigm. Motivated by the lack of such a model, we introduce a language extension specification, called QCOR, that enables single-source quantum-classical programming. Programs written using the QCOR library and directives based language extensions can be compiled to produce functional hybrid binary executables. After defining the QCOR's programming model, memory model, and execution model, we discuss how QCOR enables variational, iterative, and feed forward quantum computing. QCOR approaches quantum-classical computation in a hardware-agnostic heterogeneous fashion and strives to build on best practices of high performance computing (HPC). The high level of abstraction in the developed language is intended to accelerate the adoption of quantum computing by researchers familiar with classical HPC.;1
A Language and Hardware Independent Approach to Quantum-Classical Computing;Heterogeneous high-performance computing (HPC) systems offer novel architectures which accelerate specific workloads through judicious use of specialized coprocessors. A promising architectural approach for future scientific computations is provided by heterogeneous HPC systems integrating quantum processing units (QPUs). To this end, we present XACC (eXtreme-scale ACCelerator) --- a programming model and software framework that enables quantum acceleration within standard or HPC software workflows. XACC follows a coprocessor machine model that is independent of the underlying quantum computing hardware, thereby enabling quantum programs to be defined and executed on a variety of QPUs types through a unified application programming interface. Moreover, XACC defines a polymorphic low-level intermediate representation, and an extensible compiler frontend that enables language independent quantum programming, thus promoting integration and interoperability across the quantum programming landscape. In this work we define the software architecture enabling our hardware and language independent approach, and demonstrate its usefulness across a range of quantum computing models through illustrative examples involving the compilation and execution of gate and annealing-based quantum programs.;1
Quantum Machine Learning;Fuelled by increasing computer power and algorithmic advances, machine learning techniques have become powerful tools for finding patterns in data. Since quantum systems produce counter-intuitive patterns believed not to be efficiently produced by classical systems, it is reasonable to postulate that quantum computers may outperform classical computers on machine learning tasks. The field of quantum machine learning explores how to devise and implement concrete quantum software that offers such advantages. Recent work has made clear that the hardware and software challenges are still considerable but has also opened paths towards solutions.;1
IBM's Qiskit Tool Chain: Working with and Developing for Real Quantum Computers;"Quantum computers promise substantial speedups over conventional machines for many practical applications. While considered ""dreams of the future"" for a long time, first quantum computers are available now which can be utilized by anyone. A leading force within this development is IBM Research which launched the IBM Q Experience - the first industrial initiative to build universal quantum computers and make them accessible to a broad audience through cloud access. Along this initiative, the tool Qiskit has been launched which enables researchers, teachers, developers, and general enthusiasts to write corresponding code and to run experiments on those machines. At the same time, this provides an ideal playground for the design automation community which - through Qiskit - can deploy improved solutions e.g. on designing and realizing quantum applications. This special session summary aims to provide an introduction into Qiskit and is showcasing selected success stories on how to work with and develop for it. In addition to that, it provides corresponding references to further readings in terms of tutorials and scientific papers as well as links to publicly available implementations for Qiskit extensions.";1
A monadic semantics for quantum computing in an object oriented language;Nowadays, several languages and libraries have been proposed to program and reason about quantum programs in the imperative and functional paradigms. Having in mind that the object-oriented paradigm is one of the most used for developing general purpose software systems, in this work we propose to investigate quantum programming using the object-oriented paradigm. Hence, we present a monadic semantics for FJQuantum1, an object-oriented language based on Featherweight Java, created to reason and to develop programs handling quantum data and quantum operations. We also provide an interpreter for this semantics and a set of examples of quantum programs to run with it.;1
An approach to source code conversion of classical programming languages into source code of quantum programming languages;Basic principles of quantum computer ensure more computing power than the principles of classical computers. Quantum computers use quantum mechanical effects such as entanglement and superposition to speed up computing processes compared to classical computers. If the quantum computers one day becomes a commercially available product, then it is very important to have a converter that will convert the source code of programming languages for classical computers into source code of programming languages for quantum computers because it will speed up the translation process and ensure that developers of classical computers can develop programs for quantum computer using programming languages for classical computers. In this paper, the basic approach to automatic conversion of the source code for classical computer into a source code of quantum computer is introduced.;1
XACC: A System-Level Software Infrastructure for Heterogeneous Quantum-Classical Computing;Quantum programming techniques and software have advanced significantly over the past five years, with a majority focusing on high-level language frameworks targeting remote REST library APIs. As quantum computing architectures advance and become more widely available, lower-level, system software infrastructures will be needed to enable tighter, co-processor programming and access models. Here we present XACC, a system-level software infrastructure for quantum-classical computing that promotes a service-oriented architecture to expose interfaces for core quantum programming, compilation, and execution tasks. We detail XACC's interfaces, their interactions, and its implementation as a hardware-agnostic framework for both near-term and future quantum-classical architectures. We provide concrete examples demonstrating the utility of this framework with paradigmatic tasks. Our approach lays the foundation for the development of compilers, associated runtimes, and low-level system tools tightly integrating quantum and classical workflows.;1
Quantum Software Testing;"This article introduces some ideas and challenges related to the testing of quantum programs. In particular, it approaches functional testing, white
box testing (specially mutation) and model-based testing";1
Formal Verification vs. Quantum Uncertainty;"Quantum programming is hard: Quantum programs are necessarily probabilistic and impossible to
examine without disrupting the execution of a program. In response to this challenge, we and a
number of other researchers have written tools to verify quantum programs against their intended
semantics. This is not enough. Verifying an idealized semantics against a real world quantum
program doesnít allow you to confidently predict the programís output. In order to have verification
that works, you need both an error semantics related to the hardware at hand (this is necessarily
low level) and certified compilation to the that same hardware. Once we have these two things,
we can talk about an approach to quantum programming where we start by writing and verifying
programs at a high level, attempt to verify properties of the compiled code, and repeat as necessary.";1
Statistical Assertions for Validating Patterns and Finding Bugs in Quantum Programs;"In support of the growing interest in quantum computing experimentation, programmers need new tools to write quantum algorithms as program code. Compared to debugging classical programs, debugging quantum programs is difficult because programmers have limited ability to probe the internal states of quantum programs; those states are difficult to interpret even when observations exist; and programmers do not yet have guidelines for what to check for when building quantum programs. In this work, we present quantum program assertions based on statistical tests on classical observations. These allow programmers to decide if a quantum program state matches its expected value in one of classical, superposition, or entangled types of states. We extend an existing quantum programming language with the ability to specify quantum assertions, which our tool then checks in a quantum program simulator. We use these assertions to debug three benchmark quantum programs in factoring, search, and chemistry. We share what types of bugs are possible, and lay out a strategy for using quantum programming patterns to place assertions and prevent bugs.";1
Towards a Quantum Software Modeling Language;We set down the principles behind a modeling language for quantum software. We present a minimal set of extensions to the well-known Unified Modeling Language (UML) that allows it to effectively model quantum software. These extensions are separate and independent of UML as a whole. As such they can be used to extend any other software modeling language, or as a basis for a completely new language. We argue that these extensions are both necessary and sufficient to model, abstractly, any piece of quantum software. Finally, we provide a small set of examples that showcase the effectiveness of the extension set.;1
Integrating Quantum Computing into Workflow Modeling and Execution;Quantum computing has the potential to significantly impact many application domains, as several quantum algorithms are promising to solve problems more efficiently than possible on classical computers. However, various complex pre- and post-processing tasks have to be performed when executing a quantum circuit, which require immense mathematical and technical knowledge. For example, calculations on todayís quantum computers are noisy and require an error mitigation task after the execution. Hence, integrating classical applications with quantum circuits is a difficult challenge. In this paper, we introduce a modeling extension for imperative workflow languages to enable the integration of quantum computations and ease the orchestration of classical applications and quantum circuits. Further, we show how the extension can be mapped to native modeling constructs of extended workflow languages to retain the portability of the workflows. We validate the practical feasibility of our approach by applying our proposed extension to BPMN and introduce Quantum4BPMN.;1
TOSCA4QC: Two Modeling Styles for TOSCA to Automate the Deployment and Orchestration of Quantum Applications;Quantum computing introduces a new computing paradigm that promises to solve problems that cannot be solved by classical computers efficiently. Thus, quantum applications will be more and more integrated in classical applications. To bring these composite applications into production, technologies for an automated deployment and orchestration are required to avoid manual error-prone and time-consuming processes. For non-quantum applications, a variety of deployment technologies have been developed in recent years. However, the deployment of quantum applications currently differs significantly from nonquantum applications and thus, leads to a different modeling procedure for the deployment of quantum applications. To overcome these problems, we propose TOSCA4QC that introduces two deployment modeling styles based on the Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications (TOSCA) standard for automating the deployment and orchestration of quantum applications: (i) SDK-specific modeling style to cover all technical deployment details and (ii) SDK-agnostic modeling style supporting common modeling principles. We further show how existing model-driven development (MDD) approach can be applied to refine a SDK-agnostic model to an executable SDK-specific model. We demonstrate the practical feasibility by a prototypical implementation as an extension of the TOSCA ecosystem OpenTOSCA and three case studies with IBMQ and a quantum simulator.;1
Toward a Quantum Software Engineering;"Nowadays, we are at the dawn of a new age, the quantum era. Quantum computing is no longer a dream; it is a reality that needs to be adopted. But this new technology is taking its first steps, so we still do not have models, standards, or methods to help us in the creation of new systems and the migration of current ones. Given the current state of quantum computing, we need to go back to the path software engineering took in the last century to achieve the new golden age for quantum software engineering.";1
A Roadmap for Quantum Software Engineering: applying the lessons learned from the classics;Quantum Computing is one of the emerging areas of computing that currently generates more expectations. However, there are many doubts about its actual future projection. On the one hand, the industry shows reluctance to invest in it. The main reasons are the high costs of the hardware, together with the fact that current commercial quantum computers offer a potential that goes little beyond experimentation. On the other hand, there is controversy in the research community about the feasibility of creating and programming powerful and reliable quantum computers. The possibility of having reliable hardware with a reasonable number of Qubits seems still distant. Finally, current quantum programming tools are still at almost logic gate level, which limits the possibility of creating real complex quantum software systems. If we look back in time, this situation is reminiscent of the Software Crisis experienced by classical computing in the 60ís. This talk starts from this analogy and, analyzing the advances and the lessons learned in the field of Software Engineering in the last 60 years, raises the directions that could help to develop the future Quantum Software Engineering.;1
A Tool for Quantum Software Evolution;Quantum computing has been growing drastically for the last year due to all the possible applications that this new paradigm brings as well as its incomparable computational power. Therefore, the new information systems that will be developed in a future might be influenced by this paradigm. However, discarding the legacy information systems is not an option if those systems embed mission-critical knowledge over time. Furthermore, quantumfy every business process does not make sense because the high cost that it requires. This is why, in a future, organizations will adapt their classical information systems with new quantum applications, evolving their legacy information systems into hybrid information system. To accomplish this evolution, this paper proposes a technique of software modernization using model-driven engineering based on the Knowledge Discovery Metamodel (KDM) standard. ;1
Modeling Quantum programs: challenges, initial results, and research directions;Quantum programming languages provide necessary constructs to program quantum computers. To write such programs, one needs to understand the characteristics of quantum computers such as superposition and entanglement, which are novel as compared to programming with classical computers. Understanding these characteristics requires an understanding of quantum physics. Thus, there is a need to build high-level modeling abstractions of quantum programs for software engineers who are used to program on classical computers to understand and model quantum programs at a high-level of abstraction and independent of quantum platforms. To this end, we present some ideas for developing such quantum software modeling languages, by presenting a conceptual model of quantum programs and an example of modeling the state-based behavior of quantum entanglement program. Moreover, we present some open issues in the area of modeling quantum programs.;1
Off-the-shelf Components for Quantum Programming and Testing;In this position paper, we argue that readily available components are much needed as central contributions towards not only enlarging the community of quantum computer programmers, but also in order to increase their efficiency and effectiveness. We describe the work we intend to do towards providing such components, namely by developing and making available libraries of quantum algorithms and data structures, and libraries for testing quantum programs. We finally argue that Quantum Computer Programming is such an effervescent area that synchronization efforts and combined strategies within the community are demanded to shorten the time frame until quantum advantage is observed and can be explored in practice.;1
Proq: Projection-based Runtime Assertions for Debugging on a Quantum Computer;In this paper, we propose Proq, a runtime assertion scheme for testing and debugging quantum programs on a quantum computer. The predicates in Proq are represented by projections (or equivalently, closed subspaces of the state space), following Birkhoff-von Neumann quantum logic. The satisfaction of a projection by a quantum state can be directly checked upon a small number of projective measurements rather than a large number of repeated executions. On the theory side, we rigorously prove that checking projection-based assertions can help locate bugs or statistically assure that the semantic function of the tested program is close to what we expect, for both exact and approximate quantum programs. On the practice side, we consider hardware constraints and introduce several techniques to transform the assertions, making them directly executable on the measurement-restricted quantum computers. We also propose to achieve simplified assertion implementation using local projection technique with soundness guaranteed. We compare Proq with existing quantum program assertions and demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of Proq by its applications to assert two ingenious quantum algorithms, the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd algorithm and Shor's algorithm.;1
Software modernization to embrace quantum technology;Quantum Computing is becoming an increasingly mature area, with a simultaneous escalation of investment in many sectors. Quantum technology will revolutionize all the engineering fields. For example, companies will need to add quantum computing progressively to some or all of their daily operations. It is clear that all existing classical information systems cannot be done away with. Rather than that occurring, it is expected that some quantum algorithms will be added, so that they can work alongside classical information systems. There has been no systematic solution offered to deal with this challenge so far. This research proposes a software modernization approach (model-driven reengineering) designed to restructure classical systems to work in conjunction with quantum systems, thereby providing target environments that combine both of these computational paradigms. The approach proposed is systematic, and based on existing software engineering standards like the Knowledge Discovery Metamodel and the Unified Modelling Language. It could therefore be applied in industry in a way that complies with the existing software evolution processes. The independence of this proposal with respect to quantum programming environments is also guaranteed, making its application feasible in the changing environment in today's quantum industry. The main implication of this approach is technical, but also economic, since it enables the reuse of the knowledge embedded in legacy systems, while at the same time the new quantum-based projects are speeded up.;1
The Quantum Software Lifecycle;"Quantum computing is an emerging paradigm that enables to solve a variety of problems more efficiently than it is possible on classical
computers. As the first quantum computers are available, quantum algorithms can be implemented and executed on real quantum hardware. However, the capabilities of todayís quantum computers are very limited and quantum computations are always disturbed by some error. Thus, further research is needed to develop or improve quantum algorithms, quantum computers, or required software tooling support. Due to the interdisciplinary nature of quantum computing, a common understanding of how to develop and execute a quantum software application is needed. However, there is currently no methodology or lifecycle comprising all relevant phases that can occur during the development and execution process. Hence, in this paper, we introduce the quantum software lifecycle consisting of ten phases a gate-based quantum software application should go through. We analyze the purpose of each phase, the available methods and tools that can be applied, and the open problems or research questions. Therefore, the lifecycle can be used as a baseline for discussions and future research.";1
Selection of quantum computing architecture using a decision tree approach;Richard Feynman proposed the idea of quantum computing for the first time in 1982 (R. P. Feynman, 1982) [1]. In the last few years, various industries have started accepting quantum solutions to their business problems. Universal quantum computers are being built by Industry tech giants to solve problems in business, engineering, and science. A variety of quantum software projects are being developed using different quantum devices, algorithms, frameworks, and quantum programming languages. To correctly identify the problems that show promise for quantum advantage, to develop proof-of-concept implementations of quantum solutions, and to actually develop software implementing these solutions is a challenging feat. This paper helps ease the decision-making process in choosing the right software architecture based on the type of the quantum project.;
Quantum Computing: State-of-Art and Challenges;In this article we review the concept of quantum computing and briefly discuss the state-of-art and some actual challenges in the field of software (i.e. programming languages and algorithms) for quantum computing.;
Special Session: Noise Characterization and Error Mitigation in Near-Term Quantum Computers;A detailed understanding of the noise processes and errors in near-term quantum computers is essential for accurate calibration of gates, and for achieving optimal performance when executing near-term applications such as quantum chemistry, optimization, or machine learning problems. This paper introduces several sources of noise in superconducting qubit based quantum computers such as those deployed by IBM, describes some of the main techniques for characterizing the resulting errors, and for mitigating the effects of certain errors without access to quantum error correction. We demonstrate experimental application of these techniques on an IBM Quantum system using the open source Qiskit software library.;
A quantum procedure for map generation;Quantum computation is an emerging technology that promises a wide range of possible use cases. This promise is primarily based on algorithms that are unlikely to be viable over the coming decade. For near-term applications, quantum software needs to be carefully tailored to the hardware available. In this paper, we begin to explore whether near-term quantum computers could provide tools that are useful in the creation and implementation of computer games. The procedural generation of geopolitical maps and their associated history is considered as a motivating example. This is performed by encoding a rudimentary decision making process for the nations within a quantum procedure that is well-suited to near-term devices. Given the novelty of quantum computing within the field of procedural generation, we also provide an introduction to the basic concepts involved.;
A study on application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for cosmetics: Quantum computer is necessary for Beauty-field analysis;Artificial Intelligence (Hereinafter, AI) technology has attraction in recent years. AI technology is a combination of the software technology represented by ‚ÄúDeep Learning‚Äù and the hardware technology represented by ‚ÄúGPU‚Äù. GPU stands for Graphic Processing Unit. And the GPU has the function of performing parallel processing at high speed like a human brain. The current AI system is established by the evolution of ‚ÄúGPU‚Äù and ‚ÄúDeep Learning‚Äù. Deep learning is often taken up, but the current AI technology can't be explained without GPU evolution. Current AI technology is established with balance between software and hardware technologies. As is well known, high performance AI technology is applied in the field of driving of automobiles and security system. On the other hand, utilization of AI in the cosmetic field has been delayed. Because the current AI still can't analyze human emotions and feelings. ‚ÄúBeauty‚Äù has to analyze human instinctive area, which is very difficult. In the area of ‚ÄúBeauty‚Äù, virtual make-up is realized by image processing. Or it is used for analysis of skin color and so on. For example, take a photo of skin color by the smart-phone and customize the foundation that matches skin color. In this way, AI is beginning to be used gradually even in the cosmetics field. In this paper, we will give an opinion on the application of AI to cosmetics.;
An overview of Quantum Information Systems;In this presentation, an overview of Quantum Information Systems is given. Therefore, the postulates of quantum mechanics are given based on one interpretation that is called the Copenhagen interpretation. The main pillars of quantum mechanics are: Superposition, Interference, and Entanglement. Quantum Information Systems comprise three disciplines: Quantum Computation, Quantum Communication, and Quantum Control. Each one of them has a number of topics with some implementations that have reached the commercial level. Quantum Computation has three models: the circuit model that is using different techniques like superconducting elements and special Silicon-based elements. The Adiabatic quantum model has reached the commercial stage through a start-up company using superconducting chips. The categorical quantum model is based on category theory and one of its main applications is the study and verification of network and cryptographic protocols. Quantum communication started with defining the basic unit of information, the qubit. Then the quantum compression theorem was proved. The quantum channel capacity problem was divided into two problems: transmitting classical information over a quantum channel, and transmitting quantum information over a quantum channel. The first problem was partially resolved. However, the second problem is being researched upon. Two applications will be briefly presented: quantum teleportation and superdense coding. Both of them employs quantum entanglement. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) using cryptographic protocols has received much attention due its importance in network security. A number of protocols have been proposed and some of them have been implemented, and now a number of commercial products have been announced. Also, some experimental networks have been implemented. QKD using space links have been proposed and experimented with. In few years quantum satellites will be launched. Quantum cryptographic protocols are being proposed to protect infrastructure networks like the electric power grid. Also, it is being used as a countermeasure against global spying networks like ECHELON that are detrimental for national economies. The Quantum Internet is also being considered using quantum teleportation together with Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics with some experimental work going on. Quantum Control is essential for both Quantum Computation and Quantum Communication. Intensive research is going on in: State estimation (called Quantum State Tomography), system identification (called Quantum Process Tomography), and Quantum Feedback Control. The basic concepts will be briefly considered in this presentation. University education has witnessed major changes to support the above developments. At the postgraduate level many universities offer many courses related to the above disciplines. Recently, a number of institutions started to offer undergraduate courses and some of them have even started to introduce Quantum Engineering 4 years undergraduate programs. A brief account will be given to such developments.;
Five reversible quantum gates in Quipper;Quipper is the most recently developed quantum programming language. In this work, we provide brief background information about Quipper and use its framework to demonstrate the implementation of five non-trivial reversible gates. Each gate works as a full adder gate. We will use a Quipper simulator to run a simulation for each gate on a classical computer.;
Reverse Checking of Quantum Algorithm Execution;Verification of quantum computation is critical because undesirable interference and noise are major technical hurdles in quantum computing. We propose an approach for reverse checking of computation results that takes advantage of quantum teleportation and reversibility of unitary quantum gates. The main idea is to preserve the quantum state after the computation ends and before the result is measured, so that quantum teleportation can be performed to ‚Äúsave‚Äù the quantum state before the readout. After that, the computation is reversely performed in the reverse order of gate operations. The end result should match the original input. Any discrepancy would be proof of errors during computation or verification. The advantage of this approach is that the reverse computation circuit can be automatically generated and performed and that the error rate obtained reflects what happened during the actual computation. In addition, this approach leads to a potential way to reduce error rates in the future by discarding results from individual shots of the execution with detected errors.;
A quantum macro assembler;We present a low-level software building block intended to be used to implement higher-level programming models atop quantum annealers such as the D-Wave 2X‚Ñ¢. By analogy to a macro assembler for conventional architectures, our quantum macro assembler enables a programmer to express computations symbolically and without regard to the specifics of the underlying hardware. We demonstrate that the quantum macro assembler can be useful in its own right as a programming interface despite providing only a minimal level of hardware abstraction.;
Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics (CQED)-Based Quantum LDPC Encoders and Decoders;Quantum information processing (QIP) relies on delicate superposition states that are sensitive to interactions with environment, resulting in errors. Moreover, the quantum gates are imperfect so that the use of quantum error correction coding (QECC) is essential to enable the fault-tolerant computing. The QECC is also important in quantum communication and teleportation applications. The most critical gate, i.e., the CNOT gate, has been implemented recently as a probabilistic device by using integrated optics. CNOT gates from linear optics provide only probabilistic outcomes and, as such, are not suitable for any meaningful quantum computation (on the order of thousand qubits and above). In this paper, we show that arbitrary set of universal quantum gates and gates from Clifford group, which are needed in QECC, can be implemented based on cavity quantum electrodynamics (CQED). Moreover, in CQED technology, the use of the controlled-Z gate instead of the CNOT gate is more appropriate. We then show that encoders/decoders for quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes can be implemented based on Hadamard and controlled-Z gates only using CQED. We also discuss quantum dual-containing and entanglement-assisted codes and show that they can be related to combinatorial objects known as balanced incomplete block designs (BIBDs). In particular, a special class of BIBDs-Steiner triple systems (STSs)-yields to low-complexity quantum LDPC codes. Finally, we perform simulations and evaluate the performance of several classes of large-girth quantum LDPC codes suitable for implementation in CQED technology against that of lower girth entanglement-assisted codes and dual-containing quantum codes.;
Toward Design of Garbled Circuits Using Quantum Gates;Two-party Secure Multi-party Computation (SMC) is a classical problem in theoretical security. The Garbled Circuit (GC) approach has been proposed as a method for solving SMC using Boolean circuits. Actually, interest has grown in the efficiency of this technique and in its applications to computation outsourcing in untrusted environments. A recent work shows that EXOR gates in a Boolean circuit have no cost for the secure computation protocol. Therefore, circuits with a reduced number of non-EXOR gates are more convenient. In this work, we discuss Garbled Circuit construction for two-party secure function evaluation using quantum gates (QG). We observe that, in some cases, the quantum GC involves a lower number of non-EXOR gates than the corresponding classical GC implementations, resulting in a reduced cost in terms of Oblivious Transfer (OT) communication at runtime.;
Computer systems architecture vs quantum computer;Technology is growing very fast, every day we see new things and changes to technology. There is a lot of history for computer systems. Nearly they are for 60 years. Computer Architecture is changed from day one to till today. Based on Computer Architecture new computer systems are developed. Computer Architecture is different for microcomputer, minicomputer, mainframes, laptops, palmtop, tablets, mobile phones which are used as smart computers. Each device is having its own architectures. These systems are based on Boolean algebra. In this paper we say about quantum computers system with architecture. Quantum Computer is based on using device at required amount. Quantum Computers are one type of supercomputers, can solve lot of problems that which cannot be solved by normal computers. This is 100 times faster than microcomputers. It is based on quantum physics.;
Network Management System for Quantum Key Distribution;Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is developed to improve the security network in key exchange field. There are several success network equipments in implement QKD. However, the key distribution is limited to use in point-to-point scope. In this paper, we propose a design in quantum cryptography network that will extend the ability of number of users in present quantum cryptography network from point-to-point to multi-user network and sustain the security of the network. The developed system is implemented based on the existing quantum cryptography by managing the pairs joining of QKD system. The result of simulation is proven the feasibility to implement the proposed concept in real implementation.;
Use quantum random number generator in Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol;The development of information society, which led to an impressive increase of the volume of information, mostly economic, which was circulated in computer networks, accelerated the development and especially the use of modern cryptography tools. The role of modern cryptography is to assure by specific mathematical means, both theoretically and practically, the four basic characteristics of information: confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, and nonrepudiation. This paper presents a series of results obtained within an ample project, whose purpose is to integrate devices based on quantum properties, in order to gradually replace the current classical equipment which becomes vulnerable, and also to develop software applications. The results were obtained as a result of performance and testing of an experimental model which implements an architecture of client-server type, and which integrates a quantum random number generator in the mechanism of obtaining the cryptographic key.;
Quantum random number generator vs. random number generator;A random number generator produces a periodic sequence of numbers on a computer. The starting point can be random, but after it is chosen, everything else is deterministic. A random number generator produces a periodic sequence of numbers on a computer. The starting point can be random, but after it is chosen, everything else is deterministic. This paper presents the entropy and p-value tests performed on classical and quantum random number generators, in order to check the randomness of the generated output data. Both generators have been integrated in software applications reproducing asymmetrical cryptosystems, their results contributing to the generation of key material within Diffie-Hellman protocol. Can regard these tests as a first step in determining if a generator is suitable for a particular cryptographic application. At the same time, the statistical tests cannot serve as a substitute for cryptanalysis.;
A Gate-Level Approach To Compiling For Quantum Computers;Programming language constructs generally operate on data words, and so does most compiler analysis and transformation. However, individual word-level operations often harbor pointless, yet resource and power hungry, lower-level operations. By transforming complete programs into gate-level operations on individual bits, and optimizing operations at that level, it is possible to dramatically reduce the total amount of work needed to execute the program's algorithm. This gate-level representation can be in terms of any complete set of logic gate types;
Surface Codes Based Quantum Networking;We propose a multipartite quantum communication network (QCN) based on surface codes (SCs). We describe how simultaneously to entangle multiple nodes in an arbitrary network topology by employing the SCs. We further describe how to extend the transmission distance between arbitrary two nodes by using the SCs as well. Finally, we describe how to operate the proposed QCN by employing the SDN concept.;
Exploring Quantum Supremacy in Access Structures of Secret Sharing by Coding Theory;We consider secret sharing schemes with a classical secret and quantum shares. One example of such schemes was recently reported whose access structure cannot be realized by any secret sharing schemes with classical shares. In this paper, we report further quantum secret sharing schemes whose access structures cannot be realized by any classical secret sharing schemes.;
Numerical research on a dual-mode sampled-grating quantum-dot-based InP/InGaAs/InGaAsP DFB laser for W-band RoF application;In this paper, we design and simulate an InP/InGaAs/InGaAsP dual-mode sampled Bragg grating quantum-dot (QD) based distributed feedback (DFB) laser constituted with alternating grating and FP sections in both COMSOL Multiphysics 4.3 and VPI Transmission Maker 8.9. Sampled grating (SG) reflection spectrum is simulated based on transfer matrix method. 2D and 3D optical mode analysis is implemented in COMSOL. In theory, the Coupled-Mode Equation (CME) is used to numerically description the dynamic behavior of this DFB laser. At the meantime, QD laser space and mode model is simulated and verified in COMSOL Multiphysics 4.3. The design QD Laser emitting wavelength is 1550 nm. The mode spacing in W-band millimetre-wave domain (75GHz) and side-mode-suppression-ratio (SMSR) as high as 50dB are achieved. Finally, a spectral pure and stable 75GHz mm-wave signal with 3-dB linewidth of 10MHz is observed on an electrical spectrum analyser after beating on a wideband photodiode in VPI Transmission Maker 8.9 software.;
Beyond Quantum Supremacy;Demonstrations of quantum supremacy have become convincing enough that it's time to think seriously about what comes next.;
Plenary talk I: An overview of Quantum Information Systems;In this presentation, an overview of Quantum Information Systems is given. Therefore, the postulates of quantum mechanic are given based on one interpretation that is called the Copenhagen interpretation. The main pillars of quantum mechanics are: Superposition, Interference, and Entanglement. Quantum Information Systems comprise three disciplines: Quantum Computation, Quantum Communication, and Quantum Control. Each one of them has a number of topics with some implementations that have reached the commercial level. Quantum Computation has three models: the circuit model that is using different techniques like superconducting elements and special Silicon-based elements. The Adiabatic quantum model has reached the commercial stage through a startup company using superconducting chips. The categorical quantum model is based on category theory and one of its main applications is the study and verification of network and cryptographic protocols. Quantum communication started with defining the basic unit of information, the qubit. Then the quantum compression theorem was proved. The quantum channel capacity problem was divided into two problems: transmitting classical information over a quantum channel, and transmitting quantum information over a quantum channel. The first problem was partially resolved. However, the second problem is being researched upon. Two applications will be briefly presented: quantum teleportation and superdense coding. Both of them employs quantum entanglement. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) using cryptographic protocols has received much attention due to its importance in network security. A number of protocols have been proposed and some of them have been implemented, and now a number of commercial products have been announced. Also, some experimental networks have been implemented. QKD using space links have been proposed and experimented with. In few years quantum satellites will be launched. Quantum cryptographic protocols are being proposed to protect infrastructure networks like the electric power grid. Also, it is being used as a countermeasure against global spying networks like ECHELON that are detrimental for national economies. The Quantum Internet is also being considered using quantum teleportation together with Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics with some experimental work going on. Quantum Control is essential for both Quantum Computation and Quantum Communication. Intensive research is going on in: State estimation (called Quantum State Tomography), and system identification (called Process State Tomography), and Quantum Feedback Control. The basic concepts will be briefly considered in this presentation. University education has witnessed major changes to support the above developments. At the postgraduate level many universities offer many courses related to the above disciplines. Recently, a number of institutions started to offer undergraduate courses and some of them have even started to introduce Quantum Engineering 4 year undergraduate programs. A brief account will be given to such developments.;
SE and AI: A two-way street;This paper provides an eclectic set of challenges for the SE and AI communities, seeking to drive progress of benefit to both.;
Modifying Method of Constructing Quantum Codes From Highly Entangled States;There is a connection between classical codes, highly entangled pure states (called  $k$ -uniform or absolutely maximally entangled (AME) states), and quantum error correcting codes (QECCs). This leads to a systematic method to construct stabilizer QECCs by starting from a  $k$ -uniform state or the corresponding classical code and tracing out one party at each step. We provide explicit constructions for codewords, encoding procedure and stabilizer formalism of the QECCs by describing the changes that partial traces cause on the corresponding generator matrix of the classical codes. We then modify the method to produce another set of stabilizer QECCs that encode a logical qudit into a subspace spanned by AME states. This construction produces quantum codes starting from an AME state without tracing out any party. Therefore, quantum stabilizer codes with larger codespace can be constructed.;
A Quantum Image Encryption Method Based on DNACNot;The image is one of the most important means to store information, and is widely used in every aspect of life. However, the characteristics of images enable them to be easily stolen, tampered with, and copied. Researchers have proposed many encryption methods, with most applying only to traditional digital images. There are few encryption methods for quantum images, and quantum image-oriented encryption technology has begun to attract researchers' attention. This study proposes a quantum image encryption method based on DNA Controlled-Not (DNACNot). Based on the quantum image information, encryption parameters are obtained and transferred as part of a chaotic initial key. Two natural DNA sequences are amplified to obtain the DNA coordinate sequence, and a modified chaos game representation is used to modify the DNA coordinate sequence, which is then used to correct the sequence generated by chaos. The resulting sequence is converted to an integer sequence to obtain DNACNot. A controlled-not operation is performed between DNACNot and the quantum image is scrambled by bit-plane to obtain the encrypted image. The encryption method has high security, a good encryption effect, and a large key space. The method can effectively resist exhaustive, statistical, and differential attacks. The algorithm is easy to implement at a low cost. The encryption time of our proposed method is satisfactory, and the method is suitable for real-time encryption. Moreover, the encryption results can be transmitted over the internet and stored in the cloud.;
Exocortical Cognition: Heads in the Cloud - A transdisciplinary framework for augmenting human high-level cognitive processes;From a neurocentric perspective, H. sapiens-generated technology can be seen as our neocortex - primarily the prefrontal and sensorimotor cortices - extending and augmenting our physiological perceptual and motor structures by projecting itself into the external environment. Moreover, given our brain-based creation and subjective ranking of ideational importance, the emerging capability to directly enhance neurocognitive functionality presents a singularly foundational scientific and technological undertaking. Here I propose Exocortical Cognition (ECC) - a transdisciplinary augmented cognition framework based on a review of the literature, accelerating progress in and convergence of a range of independent areas of science and technology, and the application of technology forecasting techniques. If realized, Exocortical Cognition would significantly enhance human cognitive function and memory capacity while bridging the often-presumed gap between human and future machine intelligence.;
Quantum Zero-Error Source-Channel Coding and Non-Commutative Graph Theory;Alice and Bob receive a bipartite state (possibly entangled) from some finite collection or from some subspace. Alice sends a message to Bob through a noisy quantum channel such that Bob may determine the initial state, with zero chance of error. This framework encompasses, for example, teleportation, dense coding, entanglement assisted quantum channel capacity, and one-way communication complexity of function evaluation. With classical sources and channels, this problem can be analyzed using graph homomorphisms. We show this quantum version can be analyzed using homomorphisms on non-commutative graphs (an operator space generalization of graphs). Previously the Lov√°sz œë number has been generalized to non-commutative graphs;
Quantum dots for quantum information;I present recent advances and future prospects for self-assembled quantum dots for quantum information applications.;
Aggregated Control of Quantum Computations: When Stacked Architectures Are Too Good to Be Practical Soon;Google's quantum supremacy demonstration pitted the world's largest supercomputer against a single quantum chip. A path to further scaleup may involve a large supercomputer working together withquantum chips, instead of in competition with them.;
Splicing ET (error-tolerant) Quantum Computing System;In this paper, we develop a system with redundant splicing topology by studying the ET (error-tolerant) system, and study its unique advantages in topology. And tapped the potential of application in quantum computing. Through theoretical analysis and modeling, it reveals various possibilities for the design of two-dimensional and even three-dimensional quantum computing systems, which are widely neglected in the field of quantum computing, and combines some features of the previous ET system design. And the design methodology is discussed;
Comparison of Quantum Channels by Superchannels;We extend the definition of the conditional min-entropy from bipartite quantum states to bipartite quantum channels. We show that many of the properties of the conditional min-entropy carry over to the extended version, including an operational interpretation as a guessing probability when one of the subsystems is classical. We then show that the extended conditional min-entropy can be used to fully characterize when two bipartite quantum channels are related to each other via a superchannel (also known as supermap or a comb) that is acting on one of the subsystems. This relation is a pre-order that extends the definition of ‚Äúquantum majorization‚Äù from bipartite states to bipartite channels, and can also be characterized with semidefinite programming. As a special case, our characterization provides necessary and sufficient conditions for when a set of quantum channels is related to another set of channels via a single superchannel. We discuss the applications of our results to channel discrimination, and to resource theories of quantum processes. Along the way we study channel divergences, entropy functions of quantum channels, and noise models of superchannels, including random unitary superchannels and doubly-stochastic superchannels. For the latter we give a physical meaning as being completely-uniformity preserving.;
Advances in quantum dot lasers: Classical lasers and single artificial atom lasers with a nanocavity;Recent advances in quantum dot-based nanophotonics are discussed, including the current state of the art of quantum dot lasers and cavity-QED in quantum-dot-2D/3D-photonic crystal-nanocavity coupled systems for single artificial atom lasers and related physics.;
Parsing a Sequence of Qubits;We develop a theoretical framework for frame synchronization, also known as block synchronization, in the quantum domain, which makes it possible to attach classical and quantum metadata to quantum information over a noisy channel even when the information source and sink are framewise asynchronous. This eliminates the need of frame synchronization at the hardware level and allows for parsing qubit sequences during quantum information processing. Our framework exploits binary constant-weight codes that are self-synchronizing. Possible applications may include asynchronous quantum communication such as a self-synchronizing quantum network where one can hop into the channel at any time, catch the next coming quantum information with a label indicating the sender, and reply by routing her quantum information with control qubits for quantum switches all without assuming prior frame synchronization between users.;
Demonstrating Quantum Advantage in Security and Efficiency with Practical Photonic Systems;We discuss the current landscape in quantum communication and cryptography, and focus in particular on recent photonic implementations, using encoding in discrete or continuous properties of light, of central quantum network protocols, enabling secret key distribution, verification of entangled resources and transactions of quantum money, with maximal security guarantees. We also describe current challenges in this field and our efforts towards the miniaturization of the developed photonic systems, their integration into telecommunication network infrastructures, including with satellite links, as well as the practical demonstration of novel protocols featuring a quantum advantage in communication efficiency for a wide range of useful tasks in a network environment. These advances enrich the resources and applications of the emerging quantum networks that will play a central role in the context of future quantum-safe communications.;
Quantum-dot physics for applications in semiconductor lasers and quantum optics;This talk discusses theory developments for describing changes in many-body carrier-interaction processes arising from 3-dimensional quantum confinement. The improvements are necessary for investigating quantum-dot-laser performance at underlying-physics level and developing non-classical-light sources for quantum-information technologies.;
Practical Analysis of Discrete Variable Quantum Key Distribution;The quantum key distribution is a promising application of quantum information that provides quantum information security for daily communication. This article studies the discrete variable quantum key distribution (DVQKD), including the BB84 protocol work and the performance comparison for both ideal and practical Poisson source. The formulas used to analysis process are derived in detail. In addition, quantum information is also introduced with the principle of quantum superposition and entanglement explained in detail. This is followed by a short introduction of the quantum information and its application in real world. We also explained the principles of quantum cryptography and also the practical implementation of quantum key distribution. The detailed procedures of the famous BB84 protocol and its set-up are also explored. In the project, I used the Matlab to calculate the BB84 key rate and evaluate the performance.;
Low rank matrix recovery from few orthonormal basis measurements;Recent insights concerning the PhaseLift algorithm for retrieving phases have furthered our understanding of low rank matrix recovery from rank-one projective measurements. Motivated by the structure of certain quantum mechanical experiments, we introduce a particular class of such rank-one measurements: orthonormal basis measurements. One such measurement corresponds to choosing an orthonormal basis and treating all the rank-one projectors onto different basis elements as a series of consecutive measurement matrices. We elaborate on performing low-rank matrix recovery from few, sufficiently random orthonormal basis measurements and sketch applications of such a procedure in quantum physics. We conclude this article by presenting numerical experiments testing such an approach.;
Tensile-strained self-assembly: Tunable nanomaterials for infrared optoelectronics and quantum optics;Discovered recently, tensile-strained quantum dots are optically active, defect-free nanostructures. Large tensile strains allow us to tailor band structures for applications from tunable infrared emitters to entangled photon sources. I will discuss the history, current state-of-the-art, and future directions of this rapidly expanding research field.;
Semiconductor Quantum Dot‚ÄìMicrocavities for Quantum Optics in Solid State;In this paper, exciting progress of quantum optics in solid state is reviewed. The focus is on semiconductor microcavities with self-assembled quantum dots embedded in the active layer. Due to enormous progress in semiconductor nanotechnology, such photonic structures have become a model system for the study of quantum optics on a scalable and integrable technology platform with high potential for future applications in quantum information technology. Quantum optical phenomena have become accessible due to 3-D confinement of light and matter on the length scale of their wavelength in state-of-the-art semiconductor micro- and nanostructures. This confinement leads to a quantization of the associated photonic and electronic energy levels and requires a quantum mechanical description of the system in the framework of cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED). This approach considers the dipole interaction between two-level quantum emitters and discrete photonic states of a microcavity. Within the well-known Jaynes-Cummings model, the dipole interaction is described in terms of a coherent exchange of energy between the emitter and the resonator mode. This coherent interaction in the so-called strong coupling regime of cQED is reflected in a normal mode splitting, the vacuum Rabi splitting, of the involved modes and represents a central feature of quantum optics in solid state. Another important example of quantum optics in semiconductor nanostructures is the generation of nonclassical light in specific quantum devices. Of particular interest is the realization of Fock states which represent states containing a well-defined number of photons. Single-photon sources, for instance, allow for the generation of single photons on demand, which is highly desirable for quantum communication systems. In this context, this review paper will present recent experimental studies of quantum optics in solid state. This paper is meant for readers who would like to become familiar with this topic and for experts being interested in the progress in this field. It will cover a broad range of studies ranging from examples of fundamental light-matter interaction in the quantum limit to devices capable of emitting single photons and entangled photon pairs on demand.;
Quantum networks enabled by quantum optics;Summary form only given. Quantum networks offer opportunities for the exploration of physical systems that have not heretofore existed in the natural world with applications to quantum computation, communication, metrology, and quantum many-body physics [1]. As illustrated in Fig. 1, a quantum network is created by generating and storing quantum states locally in quantum nodes. These nodes interact over quantum channels to enable entanglement to be spread across the network.In my presentation [2], I will provide an overview of quantum networks from formal to physical. I will discuss research at Caltech for the laboratory realization of small networks composed of atoms that interact strongly by way of single photons [3-6]. The goal is to achieve lithographic quantum optical circuits, for which atoms are trapped near microand nano-scopic dielectric structures and ‚Äúwired‚Äù together by photons propagating through the circuit elements. Single atoms and atomic ensembles can endow quantum functionality for otherwise linear optical circuits and thereby the capability to build quantum networks component by component.;
Fidelity of Finite Length Quantum Codes in Qubit Erasure Channel;We consider the probability of decoding error, equivalently the fidelity, of finite length quantum codes assuming quantum information transmission via qubit erasure channel. First, we obtain an analytical expression on this probability via combinatorial invariants of quantum codes. Next, we derive a generalization of the MacWilliams identities for those invariants and use them to formulate a linear programming optimization problem, which allows us to obtain lower bounds on the number of unrecoverable sets of i erasures and the probability of decoding error. Our example shows that the obtain bounds can be very tight. Next, we derive upper (achievability) bounds on the probability of decoding error for finite length stabilizer and CSS codes. CSS codes have many advantages for practical applications. Our results show that CSS codes of small lengths, like 100 qubits, visibly lose in performance to generic stabilizer codes.;
Quantum dot devices: Technology vehicles for nanoscale physics and paths for future applications;As CMOS device scaling approaches to sub 10-nm node, quantum size effects become significant even at room temperature. Recent progress in the fabrication technology of silicon nanostructures has made possible observations of novel electrical and optical properties of silicon quantum dots, such as single electron tunneling, ballistic transport, visible photoluminescence and electron emission. Possible applications in silicon quantum dots include high-efficiency light emitters and photovoltaic devices, and quantum information processing by spin manipulation. Silicon quantum dots are fabricated either by bottom-up or top-down processes. Fabrication and electrical characterization of silicon nanocrystals by plasma processes and coupled silicon quantum dots by electron beam lithography processes are discussed.;
Basics and applications of measurement-based quantum computing;Measurement-based quantum computing is a new model of quantum computing proposed by Raussendorf and Briegel in 2001. The standard model of quantum computing, namely, the circuit model, starts with the product state, and quantum gates are applied in order to create entanglement among qubits. The output state is measured only at the end of the computing to read out the computation result. On the other hand, in the measurement-based model, universal quantum computing can be done with the preparation of a multipartite quantum state and adaptive measurements on each qubit of it. It is shown that the computational power of the measurement-based quantum computing is equivalent to the circuit model. However, the measurement-based model has provided new points of view to deepen our understanding of quantum computing and to explore further relations between quantum computing and other fields of physics and information science. In fact, plenty of new results have been obtained about relations between the measurement-based quantum computing and, for example, graph theory, statistical physics, quantum communication, quantum cryptography, etc. It's inherent multipartiteness is also expected to be more suitable for multipartite information processing than the traditional circuit model. In this talk, we first review the basics of the measurement-based quantum computing, and next explain some recent applications of it to information theory, including acausal network, topological quantum computing, and secure cloud quantum computing.;
Building a Quantum Computer (Invited);Quantum computing has leapt from concept to commercial enterprise in four decades and now the complexities of computer hardware apply to quantum computing but with the added challenge that computer fundamentals are radically different.;
Quantum Key Distribution and Its Applications;Quantum key distribution (QKD) provides a means to share a secret key between two distant parties securely against an eavesdropper with unlimited computational ability. QKD networks are now deployed in metropolitan areas, and continental-scale QKD networks have been constructed. This article gives an overview of the recent status of QKD.;
Deterministic quantum photonics with ordered systems of quantum wires and quantum dots;We describe an approach for preparing systems of semiconductor quantum wires (QWRs) or quantum dots (QDs) with perfect site control combined with good spectral control and high optical emission efficiency, for applications in deterministic quantum photonics. The approach is based on organometallic vapour phase epitaxy on patterned, nonplanar substrates, through which the QWRs/QDs are self-formed in V-groove channels or pyramidal pits. Excellent uniformity (inhomogeneous broadening as low as ~1 meV), tailored heterostructure potential, efficient emission of single and entangled photons, and integrability with photonic crystal (PhC) cavities are demonstrated. Applications in QWR-PhC nanolasers and coupling of a measurable number of QDs with PhC nanocavity modes are implemented and discussed.;
Recent progress in quantum teleportation experiments;Quantum teleportation is central to quantum communication, and plays an important role in a number of quantum computation protocols. In this talk, I will give a review about recent experimental progress about quantum teleportation.;
The quantum memory stick;We introduce a design a design for a quantum memory stick that uses active quantum error correction to coherently store a qubit of encoded information for months or years. This device is based on the model of topological error correction and can increase the storage time of a qubit of information by 10-11 orders of magnitude with a physical qubit overhead of several hundreds.;
Evaluations of quantum bit error rate using the three stage multiphoton protocol;This work investigates the quantum bit error rate as a function of the optical channel length for quantum communication using the three-stage multi-photon protocols. After optimizing the laser beam intensity that Alice uses to encode her quantum bits, the quantum bit error rates are calculated as a function of fiber optics channel length. The quantum bit error rate was found to increase with channel length. It was found that the bit error rate reaches a value of 7.3 per cent at the maximum achievable distance at the communication wavelength of 1550 nm. At 1310 and 850nm, this maximum value decreased to 6.1 and 5.6 per cent at the corresponding maximum achievable channel length, respectfully.;
Experiences in Teaching Basics of Quantum Mechanics with Scientific Applications in the Electronics Engineering Program: When Modern Physics Reinforces Capabilities in Third-Year Students to Understand Novel Technologies Applied in Physics Modern Experiments;"We reviewed experiences in teaching principles and applications of Quantum Mechanics (QM in short) in students of the electrical engineering program. Essentially we focused on the applicability of the electronics in the developing of others fields concretely in the field of quantum physics of particles commonly known as particles physics detectors and the role of DAQ systems. This paper presents experiences on the applied methodology which was used to provide to the students basic knowledge on the main principles of the quantum mechanics targeting that the student acquires capabilities to make a coherent connection between the electronics engineering contribution as a crucial component to the development of the basic sciences. Essentially this paper aims to describe the principles of QM and how it is the starting point to involve engineers students in research related to cutting edge technologies through the demonstration of the basic principles of the quantum theory in the lab. Here ""lab"" would denote a possible experiment for testing advanced QM models. We provide an illustrative example based on the role of the electronic engineering in the detection of subatomic particles in ongoing projects of elementary particles detection. Emphasis is paid in the role of the electronics engineering to design and built high resolution detectors.";
From Pre-Quantum to Post-Quantum IoT Security: A Survey on Quantum-Resistant Cryptosystems for the Internet of Things;Although quantum computing is still in its nascent age, its evolution threatens the most popular public-key encryption systems. Such systems are essential for today's Internet security due to their ability for solving the key distribution problem and for providing high security in insecure communications channels that allow for accessing websites or for exchanging e-mails, financial transactions, digitally signed documents, military communications or medical data. Cryptosystems like Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA), elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) or Diffie-Hellman have spread worldwide and are part of diverse key Internet standards like Transport Layer Security (TLS), which are used both by traditional computers and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. It is especially difficult to provide high security to IoT devices, mainly because many of them rely on batteries and are resource constrained in terms of computational power and memory, which implies that specific energy-efficient and lightweight algorithms need to be designed and implemented for them. These restrictions become relevant challenges when implementing cryptosystems that involve intensive mathematical operations and demand substantial computational resources, which are often required in applications where data privacy has to be preserved for the long term, like IoT applications for defense, mission-critical scenarios or smart healthcare. Quantum computing threatens such a long-term IoT device security and researchers are currently developing solutions to mitigate such a threat. This article provides a survey on what can be called post-quantum IoT systems (IoT systems protected from the currently known quantum computing attacks): the main post-quantum cryptosystems and initiatives are reviewed, the most relevant IoT architectures and challenges are analyzed, and the expected future trends are indicated. Thus, this article is aimed at providing a wide view of post-quantum IoT security and give useful guidelines to the future post-quantum IoT developers.;
New Instances of Quantum Error-Correcting Codes for Single Deletion Errors;This paper provides new instances of quantum error-correcting codes. According to recent results by Nakayama and Hagiwara, by using two sets of binary sequences that satisfy three conditions, we can construct quantum error-correcting codes for single deletion errors. However, only two instances of two sets that satisfy the three conditions have been found to date. The present study constructs two infinite series of sets that satisfy the three conditions. In other words, this paper constructs new infinite series of quantum error-correcting codes for single deletion errors.;
On nonbinary quantum nonprimitive non-narrow-sense BCH codes;Four quantum code constructions generating several new families of good nonbinary quantum nonprimitive non-narrow-sense Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) codes are presented in this paper. The first two ones are based on Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) construction derived from two distinct nonprimitive BCH codes, not necessarily self-orthogonal. The third one is based on nonbinary Steane's enlargement of CSS codes applied to suitable sub-families of nonprimitive non-narrow-sense BCH codes. The fourth construction is derived from suitable sub-families of Hermitian self-orthogonal nonprimitive non-narrow-sense BCH codes. These constructions generate new families of quantum BCH codes whose parameters are better than the ones available in the literature.;
Study of the effect of in composition variation in the active region and barrier layers on the structure performance of 462 nm InGaN QW lasers;We investigated the effect of In composition variation in the active region and barrier layers on the main performance parameters (threshold current density, slope efficiency, external differential quantum efficiency, radiative, Auger, Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) and stimulated recombination and potential distribution in the structure) of InGaN quantum well (QW) lasers working at a wavelength in the blue spectrum of 462 nm, in order to estimate if the performance of such a device can be improved or not as a result of these composition variations.;
Simple Quantum Computing with Quantum Bits Decoupled in Time and Space Implemented in Silicon and Coupled Back as Analog Signals and Waves Processed by Analog Computer;We propose using available silicon technology for simple implementation of quantum computing by decoupling its quantum bits in time and space then coupled back as analog signals and waves to present all possible superposition values of Q-Bits. Broadcasting waves allows Q-Bits to be available in space at different points at the same time creating an additional dimension for Q-Bits. The complexity of decoupling Q-Bits in space and time is evaluated and an optimized decoupling in both time and space is presented. We suggest using an analog computer to process the Q-bits implemented as analog signals or waves. The analog computer needs to be reconfigurable by a digital computer for initialization and reconfiguration to run quantum applications.;
Quantum Optomechanics;Quantum optomechanics is a rapidly growing field studying the quantum interaction of light with mechanical devices. This tutorial will review the field, as well as applications in precision sensing, quantum information science and fundamental physics.;
Useful Equations About Bell States and Their Applications to Quantum Secret Sharing;In this letter, we systematically analyze the parity properties about Bell states, Pauli operators and Bell measurements, which are described as four interesting and flexible equations. Furthermore, we investigate their applications in fields of secure multiparty computations, and especially present a novel secret sharing protocol with anonymous authentication based on these equations, which can guarantee the unconditional security of the proposed protocol.;
On-chip quantum photonics ‚Äî Towards commercial applications;Semiconductor quantum dots have improved their optical performance dramatically in recent years, and today a clear pathway is laid out for constructing a deterministic and coherent photon-emitter interface by embedding quantum dots in photonic nanostructures [1]. Such an interface can be employed as an on-demand single-photon source for quantum-information applications, but more generally enables single-photon nonlinearities and deterministic quantum gates. We will review the recent experimental progress on quantum dots coupled to nanophotonic waveguides and cavities enabling unique ways of engineering light-matter interaction. A single-photon coupling efficiency exceeding 98.4% is reported [2] and the coherence of the emitted photons is extracted. Furthermore, various out-coupling strategies for efficiently transferring single photons to an optical fiber are implemented [3]. Currently, the first commercial products based on this technology are being brought to the market [4]. Finally, the unique engineering potential of the nanophotonic waveguides is demonstrated by implementing a chiral quantum interface [5, 6]. The prospects and applications of single-photon nonlinearities [7, 8] and architectures for scalable quantum networks are discussed [9].;
Integrating Industry Seminars within a Software Engineering Module to Enhance Student Motivation;Engineering students increasingly demand and require coverage of emerging technologies to prepare themselves for subsequent research and employment. Industry and professional bodies are also concerned that engineering education doesn't always prepare students adequately for the world of work. The software engineering postgraduate professional practice module at University College London is designed to provide real-world experience, before students commence their industry research projects. Industry speakers are invited from a range of organizations, including ThoughtWorks, IBM, Form3, Verne Global, and Fujitsu. Seminars include: DevOps, microservices, cloud-native architectures, machine learning and quantum technologies. Before each topic is covered, students are asked their understanding of the subject matter, via questionnaires. This information is shared with industry speakers to ensure the content of presentations is compatible with students' prior knowledge. It has proved valuable to allow time for discussions to facilitate professional networking, which particularly benefits female students. Students have indicated they highly value the real-world project examples delivered by industry experts. This suggests that integrating industry seminars can enhance engineering education and motivate students by covering leading-edge technologies and practices. However, this requires considerable time in coordinating and codeveloping seminars, and such initiatives need to be adequately resourced to be effective.;
Quantum Resource Counts for Operations Constructed from an Addition Circuit;An adversary armed with a quantum computer has algorithms at their disposal, which are capable of breaking our current methods of encryption. Even with the birth of post-quantum cryptography, some of best cryptanalytic algorithms are still quantum. Lattice reduction algorithms require several arithmetic operations such as addition, multiplication, and division. Resource counts of quantum circuits determine the practicality of simulating an operation on a quantum computer. Each of the previous operations are constructed from a single addition circuit designed by Takahashi et al. and implemented in the open-source software framework for quantum computing, ProjectQ. We also include a novel approach to designing a circuit for dot product which can be used in Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization, an algorithm often found in lattice reduction. Tiepelt and Szenpieniec provide a quantum circuit for the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization algorithm. We design modifications to their circuit to better suit the implemented arithmetic operation circuits. Resource estimations are then given for small-dimensional cases.;
Quantum network coding and the current status of its studies;Considering extensive studies on network coding and quantum information theory in this century, it was just a matter of time that the study of quantum network coding was initiated. In some sense, it is rather important to ask if the amount of quantum bits communicated on a network can be reduced by allowing encoding at intermediate nodes on the network since quantum communication is much more expensive than classical communication in principle. The first result by Hayashi et al. in 2006 was basically negative for this question - quantum network coding does not give any benefit for reducing the amount of qubits sent on the butterfly network. However, this was just the first step to explore the theory of quantum network coding. After their work, it has been shown that the amount of communicated qubits can be reduced in several changes of the settings such as by allowing extra classical communication, while there has been further negative results. In this paper, we review the basic concept of quantum network coding, and report the currently known positive and negative results on quantum network coding in various settings.;
Application of PGAS Programming to Power Grid Simulation;This paper will describe the application of the PGAS Global Arrays (GA) library to power grid simulations. The GridPACK‚Ñ¢ framework has been designed to enable power grid engineers to develop parallel simulations of the power grid by providing a set of templates and libraries that encapsulate most of the details of parallel programming in higher level abstractions. The communication portions of the framework are implemented using a combination of message-passing (MPI) and one-sided communication (GA). This paper will provide a brief overview of GA and describe in detail the implementation of collective hash tables, which are used in many power grid applications to match data with a previously distributed network.;
From classical computing to quantum computing;Quantum computing is a new field of science which uses quantum phenomena to perform operations on data. The paper presents the basic theory of quantum computing and the recent results in quantum algorithm development.;
Statistical Dynamics of Coherent Quantum Systems Operating in the Presence of Quantum Noise;A statistical characterization of the quantum state of polarization for a coherent quantum system disturbed by quantum noise is presented. The composite quantum system consists of an integer number Ns of mutually polarized photons disturbed by quantum noise which consists of an average number N of thermal radiation quanta plus the zero-point energy fluctuations. The interacting and coupled dynamics of the quantum system polarization is modeled by mutually coupled energy balanced stochastic differential equations mimicking the motion of Huygens mutually coupled pendulum clocks. The Markovian nature of the quantum noise allows one to use the Fokker-Planck (FP) apparatus to develop a coherency distribution which lives on a Clifford horn torus. Using this distribution, distributions for the Quantum State-of-Polarization, the Quantum Degree-of-Polarization, the circular moments, and the azimuthal and longitudinal polarization state jitters are derived. It is shown that the stable polarization states of quantum system equilibrium define a Bravais lattice in phase space. From this perspective, it is shown that quantum polarization interruptions are at the heart of certain quantum decoherence effects, e.g., polarization slips and flips, while pendula-like clock synchronization is at the heart of maintaining and sustaining coherency among the parts (photons) of coherent quantum systems. A classical world to quantum world ‚Äútransition boundary‚Äù is identified as a function of quantum system parameters. This function is used to partition the electromagnetic spectrum into three disjoint regions of operation: a classical, a transition, and a quantum communications region. The results presented will find applications to the problem of evaluating single and multiphoton quantum communication system performance and in the system engineering design of quantum communication systems and a quantum internet connecting quantum computers.;
The dawn of quantum networks;Summary form only given. Entanglement - the property that particles can share a single quantum state - is arguably the most counterintuitive yet potentially most powerful element of quantum physics. Future quantum networks may harness the unique features of entanglement in a range of exciting applications, such as quantum computation and simulation, secure communication, enhanced metrology for astronomy and time-keeping as well as fundamental tests of nature. To fulfill these promises, a strong worldwide effort is ongoing to gain precise control over multi-particle nodes and to wire them up using quantum-photonic channels. Diamond spins associated with NV centers are promising building blocks for such a network as they combine a coherent electron-optical interface [1] (similar to that of trapped atomic qubits) with a local register of robust and well-controlled nuclear spin qubits [2]. Here I will introduce the field of quantum networks and present an overview of the latest progress, including the first loophole-free violation of Bell's inequalities [3,4] and the first primitive network experiments on a pair of spatially separated two-qubit nodes.;
Quantum entangled photon sources and their application to quantum metrology;Quantum information science has been attracting significant attention recently. It harnesses the intrinsic nature of quantum mechanics such as quantum superposition, the uncertainty principle, and quantum entanglement to realize novel functions. Recently, quantum metrology is emerging as another appealing application of quantum information science. In this talk, we will report our recent progresses on the development of novel quantum entangled-photon sources and application to quantum measurements.;
Efficient Quantum Protocol for Private Set Intersection Cardinality;Recently, we proposed a quantum solution to the problem of private set intersection cardinality (PSI-CA) (Information Sciences 370‚Äì371 (2016) 147‚Äì158). Compared to classical solutions, the proposed quantum PSI-CA protocol achieves an exponential reduction in communication complexity, since it only needs  $O(1)$  communication cost. However, this protocol requires two additional assumptions about the cardinalities of the sets, which may limit its wider applications. In this paper, we successfully discard these assumptions and present a stronger quantum PSI-CA protocol without any limitation. The new protocol ensures the parties‚Äô private security, i.e., unconditionally secure server privacy and statistically secure client privacy, and it achieves the constant computation and communication complexities, which are independent of the size of the sets. Therefore, it is more suitable for practical applications with big data sets.;
From quantum cognition to quantum agents: An agent model integrating the superposition state property;To model intelligent complex systems engineers use the techniques of distributed artificial intelligence and the agent paradigm increasingly However, the problem of decision making by components of a complex system with local, incomplete, uncertain, exchanged or observed in asynchronous manner is often present in agent models. To provide a solution to this problem, studies on quantum cognition introduce quantum properties such as superposition state and entanglement in the decision process. So how to propose quantum agents models that are capable of implementing both quantum properties of superposition state and entanglement? A case study simulating the Takuzu game illustrates our proposed quantum agent model.;
Research on the Application of Double Tree Complex Wavelet Analysis in Mechanical Fault Recognition under Quantum Control;"In view of the assumption that the wavelet coefficients in traditional wavelet analysis completely conform to the Gaussian probability distribution and ignore the difference of wavelet coefficients in different positions, a double tree complex wavelet analysis algorithm under quantum control is proposed. The algorithm takes into account the characteristics of ""high peak"" and ""long tail"" of wavelet coefficients, regards the vibration signal as the state superposition of fault signal and noise signal, introduces the mixture Gaussian distribution model, uses quantum theory to adjust and control the parameters in Bayesian theory, and realizes the nonlinear shrinkage of wavelet coefficients. Experimental results show that compared with the traditional wavelet soft threshold denoising, this algorithm has a stronger ability of denoising.";
Quantum based solutions for efficient communication networks;The quantum cryptography and quantum communications are future and emerging techniques. The quantum mechanics based algorithms offer revolutionary solutions for solving different problems, e.g., key distribution, factoring, searching in an unsorted database. From the blocks of quantum circuits, we are able to design efficient quantum algorithms which could affect our networks. In this paper, we focus on two different applications of quantum based networks and we show how quantum based solution could appear in mobile ad hoc networks and in satellite networks.;
Finite-length analysis for secret random number generation and coding theorems;Shannon theory had been considered as an unpractical engineering theory because the obtained optimizations focused on the asymptotic analysis, which are far from a practical setting. However, recent progresses are resolving this defect from achieving finite-length analysis on several information theoretical topics based on the traditional asymptotic results. These progresses enable us to evaluate the performances of realizable systems. The main factors of this research stream are the reflection for the traditional stream and the progress of the method of information spectrum, which has mainly been developed in Japan. However, we cannot ignore the effect by the min entropy developed in cryptography community and the practical demands required by the quantum cryptography system. As results, the finite-length theory has been developed in an interdisciplinary area across information theory community, the communication theory, cryptography theory, and quantum information theory. In this talk, we review the finite-length analysis for the secure random number generation as the most successful case, and briefly explain its extension to source coding, channel coding, and the quantum extension.;
Quantum Coherence in a Double Œõ - Type Five - Level System;In this paper, a two-Œõ-type five-level system is constructed by using the Zeeman energy level of the lithium atom's hyperfine structure and interacting with two optical fields which have different polarization directions. The quantum coherence effect of the system is studied under the condition of two photon resonance. Firstly, we construct the Hamiltonian of the system under the rotation frame, and get the dark state of the system by solving the eigenvalues and eigenstates of the Hamiltonian. Then, a new coupled representation is constructed by the dark state, and the preparation of the dark state of the five-level system is further studied. Finally, the density matrix motion equations of the five-level system are established, and the numerical solution is solved by program. Through numerical simulation, we give the curve of the signal light absorption intensity with its changed detuning, and from this curve. We can see that there is a transparent window near the zero of the signal light detuning, accompanied by a normal dispersion curve. The position of the transparent window corresponds to the dark state condition for the formation of the system, that is, the system is prepared to the dark state under the two-photon resonance condition, and the atoms in the dark state do not interact with the light field, so the incident signal light appears transparent.;
An upper bound on quantum capacity of unital quantum channels;We analyze the quantum capacity of a unital quantum channel, using ideas from the proof of near-optimality of Petz recovery map [Barnum and Knill 2000] and give an upper bound on the quantum capacity in terms of regularized output 2-norm of the channel. We also show that any code attempting to exceed this upper bound must incur large error in decoding, which can be viewed as a weaker version of the strong converse results for quantum capacity. As an application, we find nearly matching upper and lower bounds (up to an additive constant) on the quantum capacity of quantum expander channels. Using these techniques, we further conclude that the `mixture of random unitaries' channels arising in the construction of quantum expanders in [Hastings 2007] show a trend in multiplicativity of output 2-norm similar to that exhibited in [Montanaro 2013] for output ≈ì-norm of random quantum channels.;

Dynamic ontologies evaluation framework using quantum perceptron neural network;Ontologies can be built on systems that can evolve continuously. Ontologies analysis and appraisal are performed for measuring the eminence of an ontology. Ontologies evaluation is used to automatically reveal conceivability problems. For evaluating dynamic ontologies in semantic web and to set the weights to the neurons, Classical Neural Network (CNN) has to face a number of challenges such as the absence of discrete algorithm, limited memory capacity, time-consuming training due to the declarative nature of ontologies. CNN cannot provide low-cost learning. In CNN, data is non-linear and hard to analyze. Recently, with the rapid development of technology, there are a lot of applications such as dynamic ontologies creation and evaluation require to low-slung learning cost. However, the computational power of CNN, is that it cannot provide low-slung learning cost. On the other hand, Quantum Neural Network (QNN) can be a good computational network instead of CNN approaches. In this paper, we present a new computational approach for dynamic ontologies evaluation to the Quantum Perceptron Neural Network (QPNN) can achieve low-slung learning cost. The proposed Quantum Neural Network can construct self-adaptive activation operators that have the capability to accomplish the learning process in a limited number of iterations and thereby, reduce the overall computational cost. The proposed approach is capable to construct its own set of activation operators to be applied widely in both quantum and classical applications to overcome the linearity limitation of classical perceptron.;
Quantum network coding ‚Äî How can network coding be applied to quantum information?;Nowadays, network coding has been a very successful topic in information theory including many applications such as wireless networks while one of the simplest benefits is the efficient transmission in networks by allowing us to encode the transmitted information at every intermediate node. Since quantum information is much more expensive for communication than classical information, it was natural that this benefit made quantum researchers motivate the study of ‚Äúquantum network coding.‚Äù This paper reports the current status of quantum network coding. At present, quantum network coding mostly means sending quantum information (rather than classical information) in a quantum network. Since quantum information cannot be cloned (the quantum no-cloning theorem), multiple unicast networks have been well-studied (in several settings). We present some of the known possibilities and limitations, and future works of quantum network coding, focusing on multiple unicast networks.;

Finally, I will review a few of the problems which may benefit most from quantum computing and why many in industry are excited by the prospects.;
Hybrid quantum inspired neural model for commodity price prediction;Quantum Neural Network (QNN) can improve upon the inadequacies of the classical neural network (CNN).

A quantum inspired hybrid model of quantum neurons and classical neurons is proposed. This paper details an approach, perhaps the first attempt, towards commodities price prediction using this concept is evolved. The commodity price prediction initiates the use of QNN in financial engineering applications.;
Application of Adaptive Length Morphological Filtering in Gearbox Bearing Fault Recognition in Quantum Domain;With the problem of non fine processing of integrate mechanical vibration signal on solidification structure element in mathematical morphology, an algorithm of adaptive length morphological filtering in quantum domain is proposed, which is also used to identify the fault signal of gearbox bearing. According to the randomness of mechanical vibration signal, this algorithm quantizes the vibration signal in time domain, and is used to control the length selection of structural elements, realize the adaptive adjustment of structural element length, which is then used to reduce the noise of vibration signal. The experimental results show that the method can strengthen the fault signal and improve the analysis and noise reduction ability of morphological filter for non-linear and non-stationary signals as well as of noise reduction.;

Such a system is possible with today's technologies and would allow to demonstrate the application of quantum secured transmission, and perform quantum optics science tests. In the near term the most promising approach is using a low-earth-orbiting (LEO) satellite either as an independent nano-sat, a piggyback payload on a larger mission, or even on the International Space Station (ISS). I will outline the envisioned quantum experiments and the requirements for the technology.;
Quantum cryptography: An emerging technology in network security;The uses of computer communications networks technologies have increased the incidents of computer abuse. Because of these incidents, most organizations facing pressure to protect their assets. Most digital networks generally rely on modern cryptosystems to secure the confidentiality and integrity of traffic carried across the network. The current modern cryptosystems based on mathematical model introduce potential security holes related to technological progress of computing power, the key refresh rate and key expansion ratio, the most crucial parameters in the security of any cryptographic techniques. For that reason efforts have been made to establish new foundation for cryptography science in the computer communications networks. One of these efforts has led to the development of quantum cryptography technology, whose security relies on the laws of quantum mechanics [1,2,3,20, 24]. This research paper concentrates on quantum cryptography, and how this technology contributes to the network security. The scope of this research paper is to cover the weaknesses, and the security pitfalls in modern cryptography, fundamental concepts of quantum cryptography, the real - world application implementation of this technology, finally the future direction in which the quantum cryptography is headed forwards.;

Practical quantum optics;What does it mean if optics is quantum? Is hard core quantum optics solely concerned with the study of fundamental physics questions or is it also useful for practical applications? The course will give answers to these questions following the tradition of the two last CLEO Europe's. This year the content of the course has been modified addressing the progress of the field. An introduction to quantum aspects in optics will be given with special emphasis to phase space methods - from the lab perspective. Experimental demonstrations will underline some of the counter intuitive quantum phenomena associated with the detection process. The generation, propagation and detection of quantum light are central topics. Practical quantum optics is all about noise, noise reduction and overcoming established sensitivity limits in interferometry, imaging, communication and sensing. Such applications of modern quantum optical technologies will be addressed in detail. Mathematical descriptions of the light field and its interaction with matter will be given whenever necessary but emphasis is put on practical considerations. Possible limits that quantum effects may impose on or opportunities that they may offer for applications in industry in the foreseeable future will be discussed.

Quantum study of hydrogen stored under high pressure in a spherical cavity;This article examines the hydrogen storage phenomenon in a spherical cavity. The hydrogen gas or liquid is subjected to high pressures, leading to significant loss of mass of hydrogen, and requires materials that can withstand these high pressures and also minimize losses. For all these reasons, the problem is considered at the quantum scale. So in quantum mechanics it studies the theory of wave's functions corresponding to the hydrogen, and also, the correct expressions development of the radial functions and the spherical harmonics, and then the graphic applications that gives a spatial representation of each function with a program informatics.;

Prospect of future photonic devices based on the the quantum dots is also discussed.;
Software implementation of Bechmann-Pasquinucci and Peres protocol for qutrits;The main goals of cryptography are for a sender and a receiver to be able to communicate in a way that is unintelligible to third parties, and for the authentication of messages to prove that they were not altered in transit. Both of these goals can be accomplished with provable security if sender and receiver are in possession of shared, the secret key. This paper presents a software-prototype of the Bechmann-Pasquinucci and Peres protocol for qutrits, on two cases: with and without cyber-attack (the Intercept-Resend attack). Presence of the enemy is determined by calculating the errors obtained at the end of transmission through quantum channel. The method Quantum Trit Error Rate (QTER) for detecting enemy can be applied to the majority key distribution systems, each system having its own acceptable error rate.;

Quantum Algebraic Machine Learning;Quantum information processing is a rapidly growing industry with promising results in the near future. Its implementtation has serious impact on almost any areas of our lives: cyber-security, communication, AI, etc. Any computations can be considered as quantum ones and in this context classical computations are a subset of quantum computations. One of the most promising applications of quantum technologies is the AI, in particular, machine learning. The intriguing question in quantum machine learning is whether there are problems in machine learning and AI that fit quantum computers naturally, but are challenging on classical hardware. In this paper we research discrete optimization problem and ensemble learning in the context of pattern recognition problems. In particular, we are considering a person identification problem based on an image of his face using the ensemble learning method and approaches to the optimization problems in the context of a training of machine learning models.;
Linear Dependent Type Theory for Quantum Programming Languages: Extended Abstract;Modern quantum programming languages integrate quantum resources and classical control. They must, on the one hand, be linearly typed to reflect the no-cloning property of quantum resources. On the other hand, high-level and practical languages should also support quantum circuits as first-class citizens, as well as families of circuits that are indexed by some classical parameters. Quantum programming languages thus need linear dependent type theory. This paper defines a general semantic structure for such a type theory via certain fibrations of monoidal categories. The categorical model of the quantum circuit description language Proto-Quipper-M in [28] constitutes an example of such a fibration, which means that the language can readily be integrated with dependent types. We then devise both a general linear dependent type system and a dependently typed extension of Proto-Quipper-M, and provide them with operational semantics as well as a prototype implementation.;
On the principles of differentiable quantum programming languages;Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs), or the so-called quantum neural-networks, are predicted to be one of the most important near-term quantum applications, not only because of their similar promises as classical neural-networks, but also because of their feasibility on near-term noisy intermediate-size quantum (NISQ) machines. The need for gradient information in the training procedure of VQC applications has stimulated the development of auto-differentiation techniques for quantum circuits. We propose the first formalization of this technique, not only in the context of quantum circuits but also for imperative quantum programs (e.g., with controls), inspired by the success of differentiable programming languages in classical machine learning. In particular, we overcome a few unique difficulties caused by exotic quantum features (such as quantum no-cloning) and provide a rigorous formulation of differentiation applied to bounded-loop imperative quantum programs, its code-transformation rules, as well as a sound logic to reason about their correctness. Moreover, we have implemented our code transformation in OCaml and demonstrated the resource-efficiency of our scheme both analytically and empirically. We also conduct a case study of training a VQC instance with controls, which shows the advantage of our scheme over existing auto-differentiation for quantum circuits without controls.;
Toward a universal quantum programming language;Quantum computing may be more powerful than classical computing, but it has a radically different programming model. While current languages are in their infancy and future languages are likely to be different, now is a great time for language designers and implementers to try new ideas.;
Ket Quantum Programming;"Quantum programming languages (QPL) fill the gap between quantum mechanics and classical programming constructions, simplifying the development of quantum applications. However, most QPL addresses the inherent quantum programming problem, neglecting quantum computer implementation constraints. We present a runtime architecture for classical-quantum execution that mitigates the limitation of interaction between classical and quantum computers originated from the cloud-based model of quantum computation provided by several vendors, which implies a quantum computer processing in batch. In the proposed runtime architecture, we introduce (i) runtime quantum code generation to enable generic quantum programming and dynamic quantum execution; and (ii) the concept of futures to handle dynamic interaction between classical and quantum computers. To support our proposal, we have implemented the Ket Quantum Programming framework that features a Python-embedded classical-quantum programming language named Ket, the C++ quantum programming library Libket, and Ket Bitwise (quantum computing) Simulator. The last one improves over the bitwise representation, making the simulation time not dependent on the number of qubits but the amount of superposition and entanglement of simulation.";
Algebraic Effects, Linearity, and Quantum Programming Languages;"We develop a new framework of algebraic theories with linear parameters, and use it to analyze the equational reasoning principles of quantum computing and quantum programming languages. We use the framework as follows:
we present a new elementary algebraic theory of quantum computation, built from unitary gates and measurement;
we provide a completeness theorem or the elementary algebraic theory by relating it with a model from operator algebra;
we extract an equational theory for a quantum programming language from the algebraic theory;
we compare quantum computation with other local notions of computation by investigating variations on the algebraic theory.";
OpenQL: A Portable Quantum Programming Framework for Quantum Accelerators;With the potential of quantum algorithms to solve intractable classical problems, quantum computing is rapidly evolving, and more algorithms are being developed and optimized. Expressing these quantum algorithms using a high-level language and making them executable on a quantum processor while abstracting away hardware details is a challenging task. First, a quantum programming language should provide an intuitive programming interface to describe those algorithms. Then a compiler has to transform the program into a quantum circuit, optimize it, and map it to the target quantum processor respecting the hardware constraints such as the supported quantum operations, the qubit connectivity, and the control electronics limitations. In this article, we propose a quantum programming framework named OpenQL, which includes a high-level quantum programming language and its associated quantum compiler. We present the programming interface of OpenQL, we describe the different layers of the compiler and how we can provide portability over different qubit technologies. Our experiments show that OpenQL allows the execution of the same high-level algorithm on two different qubit technologies, namely superconducting qubits and Si-Spin qubits. Besides the executable code, OpenQL also produces an intermediate quantum assembly code, which is technology independent and can be simulated using the QX simulator.;
First International Workshop on Quantum Software Engineering (Q-SE 2020);The First International Workshop on Quantum Software Engineering (Q-SE 2020), co-located with the 42nd International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2020), was held between July 2 and July 3, 2020. The workshop was originally scheduled to be a physical event in May 2020. Due to the SARS-CoV-2, aligned with the main conference, the workshop was held virtually instead. This report summarizes the keynote speeches, the paper presentations in the workshop, and the ensuing discussions. IEEE and ACM publish the proceedings of the workshop as part of the ICSE 2020 Workshops Companion.;
Game semantics for quantum programming;"Quantum programming languages permit a hardware independent, high-level description of quantum algo rithms. In particular, the quantum lambda-calculus is a higher-order programming language with quantum primitives, mixing quantum data and classical control. Giving satisfactory denotational semantics to the quantum lambda-calculus is a challenging problem that has attracted significant interest in the past few years. Several models have been proposed but for those that address the whole quantum ?-calculus, they either do not represent the dynamics of computation, or they lack the compositionality one often expects from denotational models.
In this paper, we give the first compositional and interactive model of the full quantum lambda-calculus, based on game semantics. To achieve this we introduce a model of quantum games and strategies, combining quantum data with a representation of the dynamics of computation inspired from causal models of concurrent systems. In this model we first give a computationally adequate interpretation of the affine fragment. Then, we extend the model with a notion of symmetry, allowing us to deal with replication. In this refined setting, we interpret and prove adequacy for the full quantum lambda-calculus. We do this both from a sequential and a parallel interpretation, the latter representing faithfully the causal independence between sub-computations.";
Quantum Software: Model-driven or Search-driven? A Q-SE 2021 Workshop Report;Quantum Software is a formidable challenge. This is a conse- quence of a rst encounter between software, usually perceived as an engineering discipline, and quantum computing, an outgrowth of two complex and fundamental sciences: physics and computer science. However, Quantum Software is a signi cant creativity op- portunity. This short paper characterizes the unique opportunity, while keeping in mind the great challenge. It also stands as a re- port of a workshop (Q-SE 2021) exactly created to promote under- standing and trigger motivation to exploit this opportunity, while overcoming the challenge. Q-SE 2021 | the 2nd International Workshop on Quantum Software Engineering | was co-located with the 43rd International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2021). Q-SE 2021 was virtually held on June 1 and June 2 of 2021.;
Quingo: A Programming Framework for Heterogeneous Quantum-Classical Computing with NISQ Features;"The increasing control complexity of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) systems underlines the necessity of integrating quantum hardware with quantum software. While mapping heterogeneous quantum-classical computing (HQCC) algorithms to NISQ hardware for execution, we observed a few dissatisfactions in quantum programming languages (QPLs), including difficult mapping to hardware, limited expressiveness, and counter-intuitive code. In addition, noisy qubits require repeatedly performed quantum experiments, which explicitly operate low-level configurations, such as pulses and timing of operations. This requirement is beyond the scope or capability of most existing QPLs.
We summarize three execution models to depict the quantum-classical interaction of existing QPLs. Based on the refined HQCC model, we propose the Quingo framework to integrate and manage quantum-classical software and hardware to provide the programmability over HQCC applications and map them to NISQ hardware. We propose a six-phase quantum program life-cycle model matching the refined HQCC model, which is implemented by a runtime system. We also propose the Quingo programming language, an external domain-specific language highlighting timer-based timing control and opaque operation definition, which can be used to describe quantum experiments. We believe the Quingo framework could contribute to the clarification of key techniques in the design of future HQCC systems.";
ArsoNISQ: Analyzing Quantum Algorithms on Near-Term Architectures;While scalable fully error corrected quantum computing is years or even decades away there is considerable interest in noisy intermediate-scale quantum computing (NISQ). In this paper we introduce the ArsoNISQ framework that determines the tolerable error rate of a given quantum algorithm computation i.e. quantum circuits and the success probability of the computation given a success criterion and a NISQ computer. ArsoNISQ is based on simulations of quantum circuits subject to errors according to the Pauli error model.ArsoNISQ was evaluated on a set of quantum algorithms that can incur a quantum speedup or are otherwise relevant to NISQ computing. Despite optimistic expectations in recent literature we did not observe quantum algorithms with intrinsic robustness i.e. algorithms that tolerate one error on average in this evaluation. The evaluation demonstrated however that the quantum circuit size sets an upper bound for its tolerable error rate and quantified the difference in tolerate error rates for quantum circuits of similar sizes. Thus the framework can assist quantum algorithm developers in improving their implementation and selecting a suitable NISQ computing platform. Extrapolating the results into the quantum advantage regime suggests that the error rate of larger quantum computers must decrease substantially or active quantum error correction will need to be deployed for most of the evaluated algorithms. ¬© 2021 IEEE.;
High Responsivity MoSe2Photodetector integrated in Si3N4waveguide for quantum application;We demonstrate experimentally an integrated photoconductor for visible frequencies based on MoSe2.

Capacity and Quantum Geometry of Parametrized Quantum Circuits;To harness the potential of noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices it is paramount to find the best type of circuits to run hybrid quantum-classical algorithms. Key candidates are parametrized quantum circuits that can be effectively implemented on current devices. Here we evaluate the capacity and trainability of these circuits using the geometric structure of the parameter space via the effective quantum dimension which reveals the expressive power of circuits in general as well as of particular initialization strategies. We assess the expressive power of various popular circuit types and find striking differences depending on the type of entangling gates used. Particular circuits are characterized by scaling laws in their expressiveness. We identify a transition in the quantum geometry of the parameter space which leads to a decay of the quantum natural gradient for deep circuits. For shallow circuits the quantum natural gradient can be orders of magnitude larger in value compared to the regular gradient however both of them can suffer from vanishing gradients. By tuning a fixed set of circuit parameters to randomized ones we find a region where the circuit is expressive but does not suffer from barren plateaus hinting at a good way to initialize circuits. We show an algorithm that prunes redundant parameters of a circuit without affecting its effective dimension. Our results enhance the understanding of parametrized quantum circuits and can be immediately applied to improve variational quantum algorithms. ¬© 2021 Published by the American Physical Society;
Fast quantum circuit simulation using hardware accelerated general purpose libraries;Quantum circuit simulators have a long tradition of exploiting massive hardware parallelism. Most of the times parallelism has been supported by special purpose libraries tailored specifically for the quantum circuits. Quantum circuit simulators are integral part of quantum software stacks which are mostly written in Python. Our focus has been on ease of use implementation and maintainability within the Python ecosystem. We report the performance gains we obtained by using CuPy a general purpose library (linear algebra) developed specifically for CUDA-based GPUs to simulate quantum circuits. For supremacy circuits the speedup is around 2x and for quantum multipliers almost 22x compared to state-of-the-art C++-based simulators. ¬© 2021 IEEE.;
Acoustically Driven Stark Effect in Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Monolayers;The Stark effect is one of the most efficient mechanisms to manipulate many-body states in nanostructured systems. In mono- and few-layer transition metal dichalcogenides it has been successfully induced by optical and electric field means. Here we tune the optical emission energies and dissociate excitonic states in MoSe2 monolayers employing the 220 MHz in-plane piezoelectric field carried by surface acoustic waves. We transfer the monolayers to high dielectric constant piezoelectric substrates where the neutral exciton binding energy is reduced allowing us to efficiently quench (above 90%) and red-shift the excitonic optical emissions. A model for the acoustically induced Stark effect yields neutral exciton and trion in-plane polarizabilities of 530 and 630 √ó 10-5 meV/(kV/cm)2 respectively which are considerably larger than those reported for monolayers encapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride. Large in-plane polarizabilities are an attractive ingredient to manipulate and modulate multiexciton interactions in two-dimensional semiconductor nanostructures for optoelectronic applications. ¬© 2021 The Authors.

Checking the identity of the state of qubits using the CSWAP operator;Currently quantum computing and quantum computers are beginning to actively penetrate into an increasing number of areas and begin to go beyond the scope of only scientific theoretical activity. Therefore now it is very timely to study in detail the elements of quantum programming which quite possibly in the near future can be actively used including in industrial automation. In this work we will get acquainted with such an element of quantum programming as CSWAP analyze the logic of its operation on the classical scheme for checking two qubits for equality and also build and test a circuit that allows checking for equality of two qubits that are in a state of superposition.  ¬© 2021 IEEE.;
Inductorless Widely Tunable N-Path Shekel Circulators Based on Harmonic Engineering;Recently demonstrated non-magnetic circulators rely on the interference between a linear periodically time-varying nonreciprocal gyrator and reciprocal passive microwave circuits which limits their form factor and tunability. In this work a new class of widely tunable non-magnetic inductorless nonreciprocal circulators based on harmonic engineering is introduced. LPTV circuits rely on modulating the input signal with a square-wave clock that contains multiple harmonics. The introduced harmonic engineering concept controls the response of the circuit to various harmonics of the clock waveform the superposition of which results in the desired functionality. Two miniaturized N-path Shekel circulators have been implemented in 65-nm CMOS. The first prototype which uses a four-path structure operating in the large- RC-regime can be reconfigured for operation across 0.1-1.1 GHz with losses ranging from 2.5 to 3.4 dB. It has a form factor of (Œª2/(2√ó 106)) at 500 MHz with a power consumption of 3-21 mW. The second prototype uses an eight-path structure and operates in the low- RC-regime with a tuning range of 0.28-1.15 GHz and losses of 2.3-3.3 dB and achieves more than 20-dB isolation across a 233-MHz BW (38%) within a (Œª 2/(1.5√ó 106)) form factor at 600 MHz consuming 26-67 mW of power. To date this work has the smallest form factor reported among the state of the art.  ¬© 1966-2012 IEEE.;
A perspective on industrial quantum networks;The vision is a software-defined quantum network that enables a flexible experimental platform for developing quantum applications for industry. While components of the quantum Internet are under development the control plane remains undefined. The quantum Internet like the classical Internet will be a network of networks. Operation of an industrial quantum network is viewed as a networked control problem and a time-sensitive network control plane is proposed to enable a quantum software-defined network. Measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution is used as an example implementation since it provides a foundation for a quantum repeater and by extension the quantum Internet. Results indicate that a time-sensitive network control plane design is feasible and its pros and cons are discussed.  ¬© 2021 Author(s).;
Spherical-symmetry and spin effects on the uncertainty measures of multidimensional quantum systems with central potentials;The spreading of the stationary states of the multidimensional single-particle systems with a central potential is quantified by means of Heisenberg-like measures (radial and logarithmic expectation values) and entropy-like quantities (Fisher Shannon R√©nyi) of position and momentum probability densities. Since the potential is assumed to be analytically unknown these dispersion and information-theoretical measures are given by means of inequality-type relations which are explicitly shown to depend on dimensionality and state‚Äôs angular hyperquantum numbers. The spherical-symmetry and spin effects on these spreading properties are obtained by use of various integral inequalities (Daubechies‚ÄìThakkar Lieb‚ÄìThirring Redheffer‚ÄìWeyl ‚Ä¶) and a variational approach based on the extremization of entropy-like measures. Emphasis is placed on the uncertainty relations upon which the essential reason of the probabilistic theory of quantum systems relies. ¬© 2021 by the author. Licensee MDPI Basel Switzerland.;
Adaptive Variational Quantum Dynamics Simulations;"We propose a general-purpose self-adaptive approach to construct a variational wave-function ansatz for highly accurate quantum dynamics simulations based on McLachlan's variational principle. The key idea is to dynamically expand the variational ansatz along the time-evolution path such that the McLachlan distance"" which is a measure of the simulation accuracy remains below a set threshold. We apply this adaptive variational quantum dynamics simulation (AVQDS) approach to the integrable Lieb-Schultz-Mattis spin chain and the nonintegrable mixed-field Ising model where it captures both finite-rate and sudden post-quench dynamics with high fidelity. The AVQDS quantum circuits that prepare the time-evolved state are much shallower than those obtained from first-order Trotterization and contain up to 2 orders of magnitude fewer cnot gate operations. We envision that a wide range of dynamical simulations of quantum many-body systems on near-term quantum-computing devices will be made possible through the AVQDS framework. ¬© 2021 authors.

Resonance-forbidden second-harmonic generation in nonlinear photonic crystals;"Second harmonic generation through nonlinear nano-photonic structures is important in both classical and quantum applications. It is commonly expected that the second harmonic frequency can always be generated as long as appropriate quadratic nonlinearity is provided by the material and the phase-matching condition is satisfied. Here we present an anomaly to this common wisdom by showing that second-harmonic dipoles generated in a nonlinear photonic crystal slab can be completely nonradiative. As a result no energy is transferred from the fundamental frequency to the second harmonic even when the phase-matching condition is satisfied-A phenomenon we call resonance-forbidden second-harmonic generation"". Through numerical simulation we identify two mechanisms that can achieve this phenomenon: Symmetry protection and parameter tuning. The finite-size effect and the topological origin of this phenomenon are also discussed.  ¬© 2021 Jicheng Jin et al. published by De Gruyter Berlin/Boston.""";

Encoding patterns for quantum algorithms;As quantum computers are based on the laws of quantum mechanics they are capable of solving certain problems faster than their classical counterparts. However quantum algorithms with a theoretical speed-up often assume that data can be loaded efficiently. In general the runtime complexity of the loading routine depends on (i) the data encoding that defines how the data is represented by the state of the quantum computer and (ii) the data itself. In some cases loading the data requires at least exponential time that destroys a potential speed-up. And especially for the first generation of devices that are currently available the resources (qubits and operations) needed to encode the data are limited. In this work we therefore present six patterns that describe how data is handled by quantum computers. ¬© 2021 The Authors.

Embedding of complete graphs in broken Chimera graphs;In order to solve real-world combinatorial optimization problems with a D-Wave quantum annealer it is necessary to embed the problem at hand into the D-Wave hardware graph namely Chimera or Pegasus. Most hard real-world problems exhibit a strong connectivity. For the worst-case scenario of a complete graph there exists an efficient solution for the embedding into the ideal Chimera graph. However since real machines almost always have broken qubits it is necessary to find an embedding into the broken hardware graph. We present a new approach to the problem of embedding complete graphs into broken Chimera graphs. This problem can be formulated as an optimization problem more precisely as a matching problem with additional linear constraints. Although being NP-hard in general it is fixed-parameter tractable in the number of inaccessible vertices in the Chimera graph. We tested our exact approach on various instances of broken hardware graphs both related to real hardware and randomly generated. For fixed runtime we were able to embed larger complete graphs compared to previous heuristic approaches. As an extension we developed a fast heuristic algorithm which enables us to solve even larger instances. We compared the performance of our heuristic and exact approaches. ¬© 2021 The Author(s).;
Scalable and effective multi-level entangled photon states: A promising tool to boost quantum technologies;Multi-level (qudit) entangled photon states are a key resource for both fundamental physics and advanced applied science as they can significantly boost the capabilities of novel technologies such as quantum communications cryptography sensing metrology and computing. The benefits of using photons for advanced applications draw on their unique properties: Photons can propagate over long distances while preserving state coherence and they possess multiple degrees of freedom (such as time and frequency) that allow scalable access to higher dimensional state encoding all while maintaining low platform footprint and complexity. In the context of out-of-lab use photon generation and processing through integrated devices and off-the-shelf components are in high demand. Similarly multi-level entanglement detection must be experimentally practical i.e. ideally requiring feasible single-qudit projections and high noise tolerance. Here we focus on multi-level optical Bell and cluster states as a critical resource for quantum technologies as well as on universal witness operators for their feasible detection and entanglement characterization. Time- A nd frequency-entangled states are the main platform considered in this context. We review a promising approach for the scalable cost-effective generation and processing of these states by using integrated quantum frequency combs and fiber-based devices respectively. We finally report an experimentally practical entanglement identification and characterization technique based on witness operators that is valid for any complex photon state and provides a good compromise between experimental feasibility and noise robustness. The results reported here can pave the way toward boosting the implementation of quantum technologies in integrated and widely accessible photonic platforms.  ¬© 2021 Stefania Sciara et al. published by De Gruyter Berlin/Boston.;
Adaptive quantum state tomography with iterative particle filtering;Several Bayesian estimation-based heuristics have been developed to perform quantum state tomography (QST). Their ability to quantify uncertainties using region estimators and include a priori knowledge of the experimentalists makes this family of methods an attractive choice for QST. However specialized techniques for pure states do not work well for mixed states and vice versa. In this paper we present an adaptive particle filter (PF)-based QST protocol which improves the scaling of fidelity compared to nonadaptive Bayesian schemes for arbitrary multi-qubit states. This is due to the protocol‚Äôs unabating perseverance to find the states‚Äô diagonal bases and more systematic handling of enduring problems in popular PF methods relating to the subjectivity of informative priors and the invalidity of particles produced by resamplers. Numerical examples and implementation on IBM quantum devices demonstrate improved performance for arbitrary quantum states and the application readiness of our proposed scheme. ¬© 2021 The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media LLC part of Springer Nature.;
Advances in Chip-Scale Quantum Photonic Technologies;Quantum photonic system has made remarkable achievements in computing and communication. Serving as quantum information carriers photons are flying qubits and robust against decoherence emerging as a desirable platform to make quantum processor a reality. However with system's complexity and functionality scaling up the requirements for stability programmability and manufacturability will be in high demand. Integrated photonics compatible with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor fabrication has overwhelming dominance in terms of density and performance making it an unrivaled contender for large-scale quantum information processing (QIP). To improve the performance of individual blocks and integrate them on a common substrate is one of the core tasks for a practical quantum processor. Here the recent advances in components that constitute quantum photonic systems on silicon photonics platform including sources modulators and detectors are reviewed.

Overcoming the Rate-Directionality Trade-off: A Room-Temperature Ultrabright Quantum Light Source;Deterministic GHz-rate single photon sources at room temperature would be essential components for various quantum applications. However both the slow intrinsic decay rate and the omnidirectional emission of typical quantum emitters are two obstacles toward achieving such a goal which are hard to overcome simultaneously. Here we solve this challenge by a hybrid approach using a complex monolithic photonic resonator constructed of a gold nanocone responsible for the rate enhancement enclosed by a circular Bragg antenna for emission directionality. A repeatable process accurately binds quantum dots to the tip of the antenna-embedded nanocone. As a result we achieve simultaneous 20-fold emission rate enhancement and record-high directionality leading to an increase in the observed brightness by a factor as large as 800 (130) into an NA = 0.22(0.5). We project that these miniaturized on-chip devices can reach photon rates approaching 1.4 √ó 108 photons/s and pure single photon rates of >107 photons/second after temporal purification processes thus enabling ultrafast light-matter interfaces for quantum technologies at ambient conditions.  ¬© ;
Sample fabrication and metrological characterization of single-photon emitters based on nitrogen vacancy centers in nanodiamonds;Quantum metrology requires a stable single-photon emission and a high single-photon purity. Since nitrogen-vacancy (NV-) centers provide both features at room temperature they are promising candidates for the application in this field [1 2]. The knowledge about a suitable sample preparation technique is crucial because the quality of the single-photon emission strongly depends on the sample purity and on the spatial resolvability of the emitters. This work presents the comparison and optimization of various sample fabrication techniques of nitrogen vacancy center doped nanodiamonds on standard cover glasses. The preparation is followed by a comparative characterization of the centers of the various samples. The sample fabrication includes the removal of contaminants on the cover glass surface. This was carried out by using peroxymonosulfuric acid (piranha solution H2SO5) in comparison to the commercially available lye Hellmanex III (by Hellma Analytics). After cleaning the cover glasses volumes of various nanodiamond dilutions were applied via spin coating. In subsequent steps the nanodiamonds themselves were cleaned with peroxymonosulfuric acid too to remove contaminants resulting from the manufacturing process e.g. graphite. The samples were analyzed by using a confocal laser scanning microscope with an oil immersion objective. Single-photon purity was determined by measuring the second order correlation function with a Hanbury Brown and Twiss setup. Spectral analysis revealed the presence of NV‚àí- and NV¬∞-centers. It was shown that a suitable cleansing method has an immense impact on single-photon emission as was proven by a comparative characterization of differently manufactured nanodiamonds. ¬© 2021 The Author(s).

QBugs: A Collection of Reproducible Bugs in Quantum Algorithms and a Supporting Infrastructure to Enable Controlled Quantum Software Testing and Debugging Experiments;Reproducibility and comparability of empirical results are at the core tenet of the scientific method in any scientific field. To ease reproducibility of empirical studies several benchmarks in software engineering research such as Defects4J have been developed and widely used. For quantum software engineering research however no benchmark has been established yet. In this position paper we propose a new benchmark-named QBugs-which will provide experimental subjects and an experimental infrastructure to ease the evaluation of new research and the reproducibility of previously published results on quantum software engineering.  ¬© 2021 IEEE.;
Ultra-Wideband Switched-Capacitor Delays and Circulators - Theory and Implementation;Recent research has revealed the possibility to achieve non-magnetic non-reciprocity using time variance. However prior CMOS-based circulators rely on the interference between non-reciprocal switched-capacitor/transmission-line gyrators and reciprocal transmission-line rings which increases form factor and restricts frequency tunability and bandwidth (BW). On the other hand our recent work on quasi-electrostatic wave propagation in switched-capacitor networks has proposed a new regime in multipath switched-capacitor network operation that enables an ultra-broadband ultra-compact reciprocal/non-reciprocal true-time-delay element. In this work we corroborate these findings by implementing prototype devices of the quasi-electrostatic delay element. Our measurements of the delay element reveal that delays of tens of nanoseconds over hundreds of MHz BW are realizable on-chip in a compact form factor. In addition we apply synthetic rotation across these switched-capacitor networks to realize an ultra-broadband N-port circulator with ultra-compact form factor. We implemented a wideband three-port circulator showcasing this new architecture in a standard 65-nm CMOS process. The circulator exhibits symmetric performance across all three ports and dc-1-GHz operation for a modulation frequency of 500 MHz. The measured transmission losses of the circulator range between 3.1 and 4.3 dB matching is-15 dB isolation is >18 dB and noise figure (NF) is consistent with the insertion loss. This device occupies an area of 0.19 mm2 (Œª center2/1.9√ó 106) representing about 100-1000 √ó higher miniaturization compared to the prior art.  ¬© 1966-2012 IEEE.;
Performance Analysis of Integrated Electro-Optic Phase Modulators Based on Emerging Materials;Electro-optic modulators are utilized ubiquitously ranging from applications in data communication to photonic neural networks. While tremendous progress has been made over the years efficient phase-shifting modulators are challenged with fundamental tradeoffs such as voltage-length index change-losses or energy-bandwidth and no single solution available checks all boxes. While voltage-driven phase modulators such as based on lithium niobate offer low loss and high speed operation their footprint of 10's of cm-scale is prohibitively large especially for density-critical applications for example in photonic neural networks. Ignoring modulators for quantum applications where insertion loss is critical in this work we distinguish between current versus voltage-driven modulators. We focus on the former since current-based schemes of emerging thin electro-optical materials have shown unity-strong index modulation suitable for heterogeneous integration into foundry waveguides. Here we provide an in-depth ab-initio analysis of obtainable modulator performance based on heterogeneously integrating low-dimensional materials i.e. graphene thin films of indium tin oxide and transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers into a plurality of optical waveguide designs atop silicon photonics. Using the fundamental modulator tradeoff of energy-bandwidth-product as a design-quality quantifier we show that a small modal cross section such as given by plasmonic modes enables high-performance operation physically realized by arguments on charge-distribution and low electrical resistance. An in-depth design understanding of phase-modulator performance beyond doped-junctions in silicon offers opportunities for micrometer-compact yet energy-bandwidth-ratio constrained modulators with timely opportunities to hardware-accelerate applications beyond data communication towards photonic machine intelligence for instance where both performance and integration-density are critical.  ¬© 1995-2012 IEEE.;
Using Genetic Improvement to Retarget quantum Software on Differing Hardware;Quantum computers are rapidly developing to a point where they can solve problems faster than any classical computation. In addition competing standards for languages models and architectures are also being created. These standards are often bespoke and aimed at optimizing around a single algorithm or problem. This can make it very difficult to reuse these them should the original hardware become unavailable or obsolete. We demonstrate a method that can compile circuits more generally across hardware constraints with the use of a genetic improvement inspired search technique that includes a realistic model of the hardware. We show that this method is effective at selecting gates that can be more easily implemented and run compared to generic optimization. This method reduces the total chance of failure. To ensure that these results are practical empirical results are generated using different IBM hardware and a selection of real algorithms.  ¬© 2021 IEEE.;
Realization of In-Band Full-Duplex Operation at 300 and 4.2 K Using Bilateral Single-Sideband Frequency Conversion;CMOS-integrated in-band full-duplex (IBFD) operation in wireless links and cryogenic quantum platforms was previously enabled by magnetic-free circulators using the phase non-reciprocity from spatial-temporal modulation. In this article we present an alternative and simple integrated circuit scheme which not only realizes non-reciprocal signal flows required for IBFD operations but also improves the isolation performance by completely eliminating any chip-level transmit (TX)-to-receive (RX) coupling. The above functions are enabled by performing a direction/frequency-independent single-sideband down-conversion to the counter-propagating TX and RX signals which creates opposite deviations of on-chip TX and RX frequencies with respect to the antenna (ANT) frequency. Such a principle also broadens the isolation bandwidth and enables integrated receiver down-mixing function. As a proof-of-concept a 3.4-4.6-GHz (30% fractional bandwidth) IBFD interface is implemented using a 65-nm bulk CMOS technology. The measured TX-to-RX isolation of the circuit is 32-51 dB at 300 K and 14-29 dB at 4.2 K. The measured TX-to-ANT and ANT-to-RX insertion losses are 3.0 and 3.2 dB at 300 K and 1.9 and 2.0 dB at 4.2 K. At 300 K the measured TX-to-ANT and ANT-to-RX IIP3 are 29.5 and 27.6 dBm respectively. The IBFD core of the chip occupies an area of 0.27 mm2 and has a dc power (nominally consumed in an on-chip modulation clock generator) of 48 mW at 300 K and 42.6 mW at 4.2 K.  ¬© 1966-2012 IEEE.;
On the definition of quantum programming modules;There are no doubts that quantum programming and in general quantum computing is one of the most promising areas within computer science and one of the areas where most expectations are being placed in recent years. Although the days when reliable and affordable quantum computers will be available is still a long way off the explosion of programming languages for quantum programming has grown exponentially in recent years. The software engineering community has been quick to react to the need to adopt and adapt well-known tools and methods for software development and for the design of new ones tailored to this new programming paradigm. However many key aspects for its success depend on the establishment of an appropriate conceptual framework for the conception and design of quantum programs. This article discusses the concept of module key in the software engineering discipline and establishes initial criteria for determining the cohesion and coupling levels of a module in the field of quantum programming as a first step towards a sound quantum software engineering. As detailed in the article the conceptual differences between classical and quantum computing are so pronounced that the translation of classical concepts to the new programming approach is not straightforward. ¬© 2021 by the authors.

Automated quantum hardware selection for quantum workflows;The execution of a quantum algorithm typically requires various classical pre-and postprocessing tasks. Hence workflows are a promising means to orchestrate these tasks benefiting from their reliability robustness and features such as transactional processing. However the implementations of the tasks may be very heterogeneous and they depend on the quantum hardware used to execute the quantum circuits of the algorithm. Additionally today‚Äôs quantum computers are still restricted which limits the size of the quantum circuits that can be executed. As the circuit size often depends on the input data of the algorithm the selection of quantum hardware to execute a quantum circuit must be done at workflow runtime. However modeling all possible alternative tasks would clutter the workflow model and require its adaptation whenever a new quantum computer or software tool is released. To overcome this problem we introduce an approach to automatically select suitable quantum hardware for the execution of quantum circuits in workflows. Furthermore it enables the dynamic adaptation of the workflows depending on the selection at runtime based on reusable workflow fragments. We validate our approach with a prototypical implementation and a case study demonstrating the hardware selection for Simon‚Äôs algorithm. ¬© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI Basel Switzerland.;
Deterministic algorithms for compiling quantum circuits with recurrent patterns;Current quantum processors are noisy and have limited coherence and imperfect gate implementations. On such hardware only algorithms that are shorter than the overall coherence time can be implemented and executed successfully. A good quantum compiler must translate an input program into the most efficient equivalent of itself getting the most out of the available hardware. In this work we present novel deterministic algorithms for compiling recurrent quantum circuit patterns in polynomial time. In particular such patterns appear in quantum circuits that are used to compute the ground-state properties of molecular systems using the variational quantum eigensolver method together with the RyRz heuristic wavefunction Ans√§tz. We show that our pattern-oriented compiling algorithms combined with an efficient swapping strategy produces‚Äîin general‚Äîoutput programs that are comparable to those obtained with state-of-the-art compilers in terms of CNOT count and CNOT depth. In particular our solution produces unmatched results on RyRz circuits. ¬© 2021 The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media LLC part of Springer Nature.;
Experimental Implementation of Discrete Time Quantum Walk with the IBM Qiskit Library;This paper presents an implementation of quantum random walk using the Qiskit library given the quantum circuits extracted from the literature. We started by implementing an instance of Coined Discrete Quantum Walk on an 8-node cyclic graph. Observing the limitations of this implementation we experimented a different approach by proposing an implementation for Szegedy Quantum Walk in the IBM Qiskit library [1]. The proposed solution could be used as a building block to construct quantum implementation of other classic algorithms.  ¬© 2021 IEEE.;
Modelling Quantum Circuits with UML;None of the quantum computing applications imagined will ever become a reality without quantum software. Quantum programmes have to date been coded with ad hoc techniques. Researchers in the field of quantum software engineering are therefore now demanding more systematic techniques and methods with which to produce software with sufficient quality. One of the challenges and lessons learned from classic software engineering is the need for high-level abstract and technology-independent representations with which to design software before it is coded. This paper specifically addresses this challenge for quantum software design. Since UML is a well-proven modelling language that has been widely employed by industry for some time we propose a UML extension for the representation of quantum algorithms. Our proposal comprises the definition of a UML profile based on various stereotypes that can be applied to the existing UML activity diagrams in order to represent quantum circuits. The advantage of this representation is that UML quantum circuits can be interrelated with other UML elements and diagrams which will make it possible to represent various concerns and viewpoints of the so-called hybrid information systems. This will consequently enable classical and quantum aspects to be modelled together in integrated designs in a technological-agnostic manner that is already supported by a considerable number of existing software design tools.  ¬© 2021 IEEE.;
Recent advances in generation and detection of orbital angular momentum optical beams‚Äîa review;Herein we have discussed three major methods which have been generally employed for the generation of optical beams with orbital angular momentum (OAM).

This topic has been significantly evolved as a result these three methods have been further implemented efficiently by different novel approaches which are discussed as well. Furthermore development in the OAM detection techniques has also been presented.

Significant increase of UV reflectivity of SiC galvanometer mirror scanners for the high-power laser applications;Silicon carbide (SiC) galvanometer mirror scanners are widely used for high-speed laser scanning systems engineering. For bare SiC galvo-scanners the working range and laser induced damage threshold (LIDT) are limited. In order to overcome these limits special surface enhancement should be done. In present research an optimized multilayer coating approach was suggested. This method ensures a significant increase in SiC ultraviolet (UV) range reflectivity. The SiC reflectivity was enhanced from 25% up to the 98.5% at the 355 nm wavelength for the angles of reflection from 34 ¬∞ to 56 ¬∞. Moreover the multilayer coating designs suitable for the high-power laser systems was optimized and deposited on SiC. What is more important it was demonstrated how to reach better flatness of the SiC without affecting the coating roughness. Finally the coating has passed the high-temperature annealing humidity chamber and scotch-tape tests needed for final application. ¬© 2021 Elsevier Ltd;
A computer vision based online quality control system for textile yarns;Yarn quality control is a crucial step in producing high quality textile end products. Online yarn testing can reduce latency in necessary process control by providing rapid insights into yarn quality leading to production of superior quality yarns. However both widely used capacitance based evenness testers and emerging imaging based evenness testing systems are largely offline in operation (i.e. a posteriori). A suitable online system that could be employed to test quality of a variety of yarns in normal industrial processing conditions does not yet exist. In this study we propose an online evenness testing system for measurement of a certain type of yarn defect called nep by using imaging and computer vision techniques. The developed system directly captures yarn images on a spinning frame and uses Viola-Jones object detection algorithm for real-time detection of nep defects. The validation of nep detection algorithms and comparison of the new method with an existing evenness tester in terms of nep count demonstrated its reasonable defect detection accuracy and promising potential for application in wider yarn spinning industry. ¬© 2021 The Authors;
Entanglement-Induced Barren Plateaus;We argue that an excess in entanglement between the visible and hidden units in a quantum neural network can hinder learning. In particular we show that quantum neural networks that satisfy a volume law in the entanglement entropy will give rise to models that are not suitable for learning with high probability. Using arguments from quantum thermodynamics we then show that this volume law is typical and that there exists a barren plateau in the optimization landscape due to entanglement. More precisely we show that for any bounded objective function on the visible layers the Lipshitz constants of the expectation value of that objective function will scale inversely with the dimension of the hidden subsystem with high probability. We show how this can cause both gradient-descent and gradient-free methods to fail. We note that similar problems can happen with quantum Boltzmann machines although stronger assumptions on the coupling between the hidden and/or visible subspaces are necessary. We highlight how pretraining such generative models may provide a way to navigate these barren plateaus. ¬© 2021 authors.;
Efficient brillouin optomechanical interaction assisted by piezomechanics on the SOI platform;A hybrid silicon/aluminum nitride waveguide on the silicon-on-insulator platform is proposed to achieve an efficient Brillouin optomechanical interaction. Both intra-optical-mode and inter-optical-mode Brillouin scattering can be achieved. The novel arrangement of symmetric electrodes provides out-of-plane electric fields for piezoelectric materials and the possibility of suspended waveguides and cavities. The piezomechanical interaction coupling strength and the Brillouin optomechanical interaction coupling strength are numerically calculated. The simulation results show that near-unity internal conversion efficiency from the microwave domain to the optical domain can be achieved. Relatively low microwave power can be used to produced up to 5 order sidebands acousto-optical modulation. The proposed scheme paves the way for efficient classical and quantum application in integrated silicon photonics. ¬© 2009-2012 IEEE.;
Non-Gaussian Quantum States and Where to Find Them;Gaussian states have played an important role in the physics of continuous-variable quantum systems. They are appealing for the experimental ease with which they can be produced and for their compact and elegant mathematical description. Nevertheless many proposed quantum technologies require us to go beyond the realm of Gaussian states and introduce non-Gaussian elements. In this Tutorial we provide a roadmap for the physics of non-Gaussian quantum states. We introduce the phase-space representations as a framework to describe the different properties of quantum states in continuous-variable systems. We then use this framework in various ways to explore the structure of the state space. We explain how non-Gaussian states can be characterized not only through the negative values of their Wigner function but also via other properties such as quantum non-Gaussianity and the related stellar rank. For multimode systems we are naturally confronted with the question of how non-Gaussian properties behave with respect to quantum correlations. To answer this question we first show how non-Gaussian states can be created by performing measurements on a subset of modes in a Gaussian state. Then we highlight that these measured modes must be correlated via specific quantum correlations to the remainder of the system to create quantum non-Gaussian or Wigner-negative states. On the other hand non-Gaussian operations are also shown to enhance or even create quantum correlations. Finally we demonstrate that Wigner negativity is a requirement to violate Bell inequalities and to achieve a quantum computational advantage. At the end of the Tutorial we also provide an overview of several experimental realizations of non-Gaussian quantum states in quantum optics and beyond. ¬© 2021 authors.

Strong Zero-Phonon Transition from Point Defect-Stacking Fault Complexes in Silicon Carbide Nanowires;Crystallographic defects such as vacancies and stacking faults engineer electronic band structure at the atomic level and create zero- and two-dimensional quantum structures in crystals. The combination of these point and planar defects can generate a new type of defect complex system. Here we investigate silicon carbide nanowires that host point defects near stacking faults. These point-planar defect complexes in the nanowire exhibit outstanding optical properties of high-brightness single photons (>360 kcounts/s) a fast recombination time (<1 ns) and a high Debye-Waller factor (>50%). These distinct optical properties of coupled point-planar defects lead to an unusually strong zero-phonon transition essential for achieving highly efficient quantum interactions between multiple qubits. Our findings can be extended to other defects in various materials and therefore offer a new perspective for engineering defect qubits. ¬© 2021 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.;

Software tools for quantum control: Improving quantum computer performance through noise and error suppression;Effectively manipulating quantum computing (QC) hardware in the presence of imperfect devices and control systems is a central challenge in realizing useful quantum computers. Susceptibility to noise critically limits the performance and capabilities of today's so-called noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices as well as any future QC technologies. Fortunately quantum control enables efficient execution of quantum logic operations and quantum algorithms with built-in robustness to errors and without the need for complex logical encoding. In this manuscript we introduce software tools for the application and integration of quantum control in QC research serving the needs of hardware R&D teams algorithm developers and end users. We provide an overview of a set of Python-based classical software tools for creating and deploying optimized quantum control solutions at various layers of the QC software stack. We describe a software architecture leveraging both high-performance distributed cloud computation and local custom integration into hardware systems and explain how key functionality is integrable with other software packages and quantum programming languages. Our presentation includes a detailed mathematical overview of key features including a flexible optimization toolkit engineering-inspired filter functions for analyzing noise susceptibility in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces and new approaches to noise and hardware characterization. Pseudocode is presented in order to elucidate common programming workflows for these tasks and performance benchmarking is reported for numerically intensive tasks highlighting the benefits of the selected cloud-compute architecture. Finally we present a series of case studies demonstrating the application of quantum control solutions derived from these tools in real experimental settings using both trapped-ion and superconducting quantum computer hardware.  ¬© 2021 IOP Publishing Ltd.;
Adaptive Generalized Measurement for Unambiguous State Discrimination of Quaternary Phase-Shift-Keying Coherent States;Generalized quantum measurements identifying nonorthogonal states without ambiguity often play an indispensable role in various quantum applications. For such an unambiguous state-discrimination scenario we have a finite probability of obtaining inconclusive results and minimizing the probability of inconclusive results is of particular importance. In this paper we experimentally demonstrate an adaptive generalized measurement that can unambiguously discriminate the quaternary phase-shift-keying coherent states with a near-optimal performance. Our scheme is composed of displacement operations single-photon detections and adaptive control of the displacements dependent on a history of photon-detection outcomes. Our experimental results show a clear improvement of both a probability of conclusive results and a ratio of erroneous decision caused by unavoidable experimental imperfections over conventional static generalized measurements.  ¬© 2021 authors.

Quo Vadis Metasurfaces?;The full manipulation of intrinsic properties of electromagnetic waves has become the central target in various modern optical technologies. Optical metasurfaces have been suggested for a complete control of light-matter interaction with subwavelength structures and they have been explored widely in the past decade for creating next-generation multifunctional flat-optics devices. The current studies of metasurfaces have reached a mature stage where common materials basic optical physics and conventional engineering tools have been explored extensively for various applications such as light bending metalenses metaholograms and many others. A natural question is where the future research on metasurfaces will be going: Quo vadis metasurfaces? In this Mini Review we provide perspectives on the future developments of optical metasurfaces. Specifically we highlight recent progresses on hybrid metasurfaces employing low-dimensional materials and discuss biomedical computational and quantum applications of metasurfaces followed by discussions of challenges and foreseeing the future of metasurface physics and engineering. ¬© 2021 American Chemical Society;
Reconfigurable Quantum Local Area Network over Deployed Fiber;Practical quantum networking architectures are crucial for scaling the connection of quantum resources. Yet quantum network testbeds have thus far underutilized the full capabilities of modern lightwave communications such as flexible-grid bandwidth allocation. In this work we implement flex-grid entanglement distribution in a deployed network for the first time connecting nodes in three distinct campus buildings time synchronized via the Global Positioning System. We quantify the quality of the distributed polarization entanglement via log-negativity which offers a generic metric of link performance in entangled bits per second. After demonstrating successful entanglement distribution for two allocations of our eight dynamically reconfigurable channels we realize the first deployed fiber network demonstration of remote state preparation (RSP) a fundamental quantum communications protocol with utility for performing remote private ‚Äúblind‚Äù quantum computing. We further demonstrate RSP not only at one location but over three nodes in three locations. In general our results highlight an advanced paradigm for managing entanglement resources in quantum networks of ever-increasing complexity and service demands. ¬© 2021 Published by the American Physical Society;
Efficient Hardware Implementation of PQC Primitives and PQC algorithms Using High-Level Synthesis;Efficient and quantum-resistant Post-Quantum Cryptographic (PQC) algorithms need to be built before development of large-scale quantum which will break RSA and Elliptic Curve cryptography based existing public key infrastructure. Cryptographers are developing quantum-resistant PQC algorithms which consist of PQC primitives. These primitives act as a basic building blocks that play a vital role in security and resource utilization. Hence efficient and precise implementation of PQC primitives is crucial for stable PQC algorithms. This paper implements and optimizes PQC primitives using High-level synthesis. High-level synthesis produces area-optimized and speed-optimized solutions for the primitives. These solutions create efficient and constant-time PQC designs that keep the hardware secure against timing side-channel attack. ¬© 2021 IEEE.;
Asymmetric Quantum Concatenated and Tensor Product Codes with Large Z-Distances;In this paper we present a new construction of asymmetric quantum codes (AQCs) by combining classical concatenated codes (CCs) with tensor product codes (TPCs) called asymmetric quantum concatenated and tensor product codes (AQCTPCs) which have the following three advantages. First only the outer codes in AQCTPCs need to satisfy the orthogonal constraint in quantum codes and any classical linear code can be used for the inner which makes AQCTPCs very easy to construct. Second most AQCTPCs are highly degenerate which means they can correct many more errors than their classical TPC counterparts. Consequently we construct several families of AQCs with better parameters than known results in the literature. Third AQCTPCs can be efficiently decoded although they are degenerate provided that the inner and outer codes are efficiently decodable. In particular we significantly reduce the inner decoding complexity of TPCs from Œ© (n2n1)(a>1) to O(n 2) by considering error degeneracy where n 1 and n2 are the block length of the inner code and the outer code respectively. Furthermore we generalize our concatenation scheme by using the generalized CCs and TPCs correspondingly.  ¬© 1972-2012 IEEE.;
RF Performance Benchmarking of TSV Integrated Surface Electrode Ion Trap for Quantum Computing;Surface electrode ion trap is highly promising for practical quantum computing due to its superior controllability on the trapped ions. With advanced microfabrication techniques silicon has been developed as an ion trap substrate for delicate surface electrodes design and monolithic electro-optical components integration. However the high RF loss of silicon hinders the possible large-scale implementation. In this work we demonstrate a through silicon via (TSV) integrated ion trap which has low RF loss due to the elimination of wire bonding (WB) pads on the surface and the miniaturization of form factor. We also fabricate two types of conventional WB traps with or without a grounding screen layer. The RF performances of different ion traps are tested and compared in terms of on-chip S-parameter postpackaging resonance and resulting power loss. The results show that the TSV trap has low S21 (0.2 dB at 50 MHz) high $Q$ factor (22) and low power loss (0.26 W) compared to WB traps. In addition 3-D finite element modeling (FEM) is employed for electric field visualization and RF loss analysis of different traps. The extracted results from the modeling show a decent agreement with the measurements. In addition to various RF tests the design fabrication and ion trapping operation of different ion traps are presented. This work provides insights into RF loss of ion trapping devices and offers a new solution for RF loss reduction.  ¬© 2011-2012 IEEE.;
Identifying Bug Patterns in Quantum Programs;Bug patterns are erroneous code idioms or bad coding practices that have been proved to fail time and time again which are usually caused by the misunderstanding of a programming language's features the use of erroneous design patterns or simple mistakes sharing common behaviors. This paper identifies and categorizes some bug patterns in the quantum programming language Qiskit and briefly discusses how to eliminate or prevent those bug patterns. We take this research as the first step to provide an underlying basis for debugging and testing quantum programs.  ¬© 2021 IEEE.;
Many-Body Physics in the NISQ Era: Quantum Programming a Discrete Time Crystal;Recent progress in the realm of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices [J. Preskill Quantum 2 79 (2018)] represents an exciting opportunity for many-body physics by introducing new laboratory platforms with unprecedented control and measurement capabilities. We explore the implications of NISQ platforms for many-body physics in a practical sense: we ask which physical phenomena in the domain of quantum statistical mechanics they may realize more readily than traditional experimental platforms. While a universal quantum computer can simulate any system the eponymous noise inherent to NISQ devices practically favors certain simulation tasks over others in the near term. As a particularly well-suited target we identify discrete time crystals (DTCs) novel nonequilibrium states of matter that break time translation symmetry. These can only be realized in the intrinsically out-of-equilibrium setting of periodically driven quantum systems stabilized by disorder-induced many-body localization. While promising precursors of the DTC have been observed across a variety of experimental platforms - ranging from trapped ions to nitrogen-vacancy centers to NMR crystals - none have all the necessary ingredients for realizing a fully fledged incarnation of this phase and for detecting its signature long-range spatiotemporal order. We show that a new generation of quantum simulators can be programmed to realize the DTC phase and to experimentally detect its dynamical properties a task requiring extensive capabilities for programmability initialization and readout. Specifically the architecture of Google's Sycamore processor is a remarkably close match for the task at hand. We also discuss the effects of environmental decoherence and how they can be distinguished from 'internal' decoherence coming from closed-system thermalization dynamics. Already with existing technology and noise levels we find that DTC spatiotemporal order would be observable over hundreds of periods with parametric improvements to come as the hardware advances. ¬© 2021 authors.

Analog Quantum Simulation of Non-Condon Effects in Molecular Spectroscopy;In this work we present a linear optical implementation for analog quantum simulation of molecular vibronic spectra incorporating the non-Condon scattering operation with a quadratically small truncation error. To date analog and digital quantum algorithms for achieving quantum speedup have been suggested only in the Condon regime which refers to a transition dipole moment that is independent of nuclear coordinates. For analog quantum optical simulation beyond the Condon regime (i.e. non-Condon transitions) the resulting nonunitary scattering operations must be handled appropriately in a linear optical network. In this paper we consider the first- and second-order Herzberg-Teller expansions of the transition dipole moment operator for the non-Condon effect for implementation on linear optical quantum hardware. We believe that the method opens a new way to approximate arbitrary nonunitary operations in analog and digital quantum simulations. We report in silico simulations of the vibronic spectra for naphthalene phenanthrene and benzene to support our findings.  ¬© ;

Welcome Message: Q-SE 2021;Two novel resonant-cavity-enhanced (RCE) GeSn single-photon avalanche photodiode (SPAD) detectors are designed and simulated for high-efficiency single-photon detection at 1550 and 2000 nm wavelength at room temperature for sensing and optical quantum applications. The RCE GeSn SPAD consists of a PIPIN GeSn/Si heterostructures embedded in an optical cavity formed by a distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) and GeSn surface. The results show that high photon absorption efficiency and avalanche triggering probabilities can be achieved by careful design of DBR reflectors GeSn absorber doping concentrations of Si charge sheet layer and multiplication layer which lead to a high single-photon detection efficiency (SPDE) of 80% which is promising for emerging quantum applications demanding high SPDE such as linear optical quantum computing. The noise equivalent power (NEP) and dark count rate (DCR) as a function of threading dislocations density (TDD) are examined as well. It is found that the device could operate near room temperature with a similar DCR level to that of Ge SPAD operating at low temperature. A NEP of \sim 3\times 10^{-15;
A high-T cvan der Waals superconductor based photodetector with ultra-high responsivity and nanosecond relaxation time;Photodetectors based on nano-structured superconducting thin films are currently some of the most sensitive quantum sensors and are key enabling technologies in such broad areas as quantum information quantum computation and radio-astronomy. However their broader use is held back by the low operation temperatures which require expensive cryostats. Here we demonstrate a high-T c superconducting photodetector which shows orders of magnitude improved performance characteristics of any superconducting detector operated above 77 K with a responsivity of 9.61 104 V W-1 theoretically achievable noise equivalent power of 15.9 fW Hz1/2 and nanosecond relaxation times. At 15 K the detector reaches an ultra-high performance of 2.33 107 V W-1 and 55.2 aW Hz1/2. It is based on van der Waals heterostructures of the high temperature superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+Œ¥  which are shaped into nano-wires with ultra-small form factor using focused helium ion beam irradiation. To highlight the versatility of the detector we demonstrate its fabrication and operation on a telecom grade SiN waveguide chip. Our detector significantly relaxes the demands of practical applications of superconducting detectors and displays its possible potential for photonics based quantum applications.  ¬© 2021 IOP Publishing Ltd.;

Poster: Fuzz Testing of Quantum Program;Nowadays quantum program is widely used and quickly developed. However the absence of testing methodology restricts their quality. Different input format and operator from traditional program make this issue hard to resolve. In this paper we present QuanFuzz a search-based test input generator for quantum program. We define the quantum sensitive information to evaluate test input for quantum program and use matrix generator to generate test cases with higher coverage. Because of the impossibility of copying qubit we record the operations which lead initial seeds to test inputs instead of recording qubits themselves. First we extract quantum sensitive information - measurement operations on those quantum registers and the sensitive branches associated with those measurement results from the quantum source code. Then we use the sensitive information guided algorithm to mutate the initial input matrix and select those matrices which improve the probability weight for a value of the quantum register to trigger the sensitive branch. QuanFuzz on benchmarks and acquired 20% - 60% more coverage compared to traditional testing methods. ¬© 2021 IEEE.;
On the resource consumption of Software quantum computing simulators [Sobre el consumo de recursos de los simuladores cu√°nticos en Software];Recently several real quantum devices have become available through the cloud. Nevertheless they are expected to be very limited in the near term in the number and quality of the fundamental storage element the qubit. Therefore software quantum simulators are the only widely available tools to design and test quantum algorithms. However the representation of quantum computing components in classical computers consumes a big amount of resources. This work describes how to model the main elements of quantum computing in a classical computer and depicts resource consumption using two popular quantum simulators. In the end we discuss different approaches to overcome this problem. ¬© The author licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.;
On Double Full-Stack Communication-Enabled Architectures for Multicore Quantum Computers;Despite its tremendous potential it is still unclear how quantum computing will scale to satisfy the requirements of its most powerful applications. Among other issues there are hard limits to the number of qubits that can be integrated into a single chip. Multicore architectures are a firm candidate for unlocking the scalability of quantum processors. Nonetheless the vulnerability and complexity of quantum communications make this a challenging approach. A comprehensive design should imply consolidating the communications stack in the quantum computer architecture. In this article we explain how this vision by entangling communications and computation in the core of the design may help to solve the open challenges. We also summarize the first results of our application of structured design methodologies backing this vision. With our work we hope to contribute with design guidelines that may help unleash the potential of quantum computing.  ¬© 1981-2012 IEEE.;
Qibam: Approximate sub-string index search on quantum accelerators applied to DNA read alignment;With small-scale quantum processors transitioning from experimental physics labs to industrial products these processors in a few years are expected to scale up and be more robust for efficiently computing important algorithms in various fields. In this paper we propose a quantum algorithm to address the challenging field of data processing for genome sequence reconstruction. This research describes an architecture-aware implementation of a quantum algorithm for subsequence alignment. A new algorithm named QiBAM (quantum indexed bidirectional associative memory) is proposed which uses approximate pattern-matching based on Hamming distances. QiBAM extends the Grover‚Äôs search algorithm in two ways allowing: (1) approximate matches needed for read errors in genomics and (2) a distributed search for multiple solutions over the quantum encoding of DNA sequences. This approach gives a quadratic speedup over the classical algorithm. A full implementation of the algorithm is provided and verified using the OpenQL compiler and QX Simulator framework. Our implementation represents a first exploration towards a full-stack quantum accelerated genome sequencing pipeline design. ¬© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI Basel Switzerland.;

Quantum application: A smart cashier-less shopping application with biometric payment authentication;Retailing is an important business activity that enables consumers to buy products and services from different merchants. In 2018 469024 establishments for wholesale and retail trade had been in the range of Malaysian retail firms. However currently Malaysia's retail sector remains in its comfort zone where the technology used in retail shops is obsolete and does not interact with consumers.

A Cryogenic Broadband Sub-1-dB NF CMOS Low Noise Amplifier for Quantum Applications;A cryogenic broadband low noise amplifier (LNA) for quantum applications based on a standard 40-nm CMOS technology is reported. The LNA specifications are derived from the readout of semiconductor quantum bits at 4.2 K whose quantum information signals are characterized as phase-modulated signals. To achieve broadband input matching impedance and low noise figure the gate-to-drain capacitance of the input transistor is exploited. The goal is to involve a resistive and capacitive load into the input impedance match of a common-source stage with source inductive degeneration. The capacitive load is created by an LC parallel tank whose resonant frequency is lower than the operating frequency. The achieved non-constant in-band equivalent capacitance is proven to be beneficial to input impedance matching. The resistive part of the load is provided by the transconductance of the cascode stage implicitly. An inductor is added to the gate of the cascode transistor to suppress its noise and a transformer-based resonator with two resonant frequencies serves as the load of the first stage thus extending the operating bandwidth. Design considerations for the cryogenic temperature operation of the LNA are proposed and analyzed. The LNA achieves a measured gain (S_21) of 35 ¬± 0.5 dB return loss > 12 dB and NF of 0.75-1.3 dB across the band (4.1-7.9 GHz) with 51.1-mW power consumption at room temperature while it shows a measured gain of 42 ¬± 3.3 dB and NF of 0.23-0.65 dB with 39-mW power consumption at 4.2 K between 4.6 and 8 GHz. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report of a cryogenic LNA based on a bulk CMOS process working above 4 GHz showing sub-1-dB NF both at room and cryogenic temperatures.  ¬© 1966-2012 IEEE.;
QProv: A provenance system for quantum computing;Quantum computing promises breakthroughs in various application areas such as machine learning chemistry or simulations. However today‚Äôs quantum computers are error-prone and have limited capabilities. This leads to various challenges when developing and executing quantum algorithms for example the mitigation of occurring errors or the selection of a suitable quantum computer to execute a certain quantum circuit. To address these challenges detailed information about the quantum circuit to be executed as well as past executions and the up-to-date information about the available quantum computers are required. Thus this data must be continuously collected and stored in the long-term which is currently not supported. To overcome this problem a provenance approach is introduced for quantum computing. Therefore relevant provenance attributes that should be gathered in the area of quantum computing are identified. Furthermore QProv a provenance system that automatically collects the identified provenance attributes and provides them in a uniform manner to the user is introduced. Finally a case study with the collected provenance data and corresponding use cases that can benefit from this provenance data are presented here. ¬© 2021 The Authors.

Optical near-field measurement for spin-orbit interaction of light;Since the seminal work by J. H. Poynting light has been known to carry momentum and angular momentum. The typical dynamical features of light and its interactions‚Äîtermed spin‚Äìorbit interactions (SOIs) which have been investigated intensely over the last 30 years‚Äîplay a crucial role in various light-matter interactions for example: spin Hall effect spin‚Äìorbit conversion helicity-controlled unidirectional excitation of light and their inverse effects which leads to plenty of applications including optical manipulation communications imaging sensing nanometrology on-chip optoelectronic technologies and interdisciplinary researches. In particular the SOI of light in isotropic inhomogeneous media is a fine subwavelength effect accomplished through the intrinsic coupling between light's phase polarization and position. Therefore the traditional methods of near-field measurements such as near field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM) have been widely employed to reveal the optical SOIs intuitively by measuring the intensity of light. Very recently with modern advanced nanofabrication techniques many measurement techniques based on nanoparticles nanoantennas and nanoprobes of special designs have been proposed to understand the optical SOIs visually by characterizing the polarization and spin/orbital features of light. This endeavor has led to the development of chiral quantum optics spin optics and topological photonics and resulted in novel applications requiring optical manipulations and angular momentum communications chiral imaging nanometrology and robust spin-based devices and techniques for quantum technologies. Here we review the near-field techniques for measurements of optical SOIs together with their potential applications. We start with a theoretical overview of momentum and angular momentum properties of generic optical fields and typical phenomena involving optical SOIs. Then we overview the theoretical basis and latest achievements of the near-field measurement techniques including NSOM optical manipulations nanoantenna and nanoprobes of special designs all relevant to optical SOIs. A comprehensive classification is then constructed of all known methods of optical near-field measurements for the SOI of light and novel techniques identified for future applications. ¬© 2021 Elsevier Ltd;

Propagation stability in optical fibers: Role of path memory and angular momentum;With growing interest in the spatial dimension of light multimode fibers which support eigenmodes with unique spatial and polarization attributes have experienced resurgent attention. Exploiting this spatial diversity often requires robust modes during propagation which in realistic fibers experience perturbations such as bends and path redirections. By isolating the effects of different perturbations an optical fiber experiences we study the fundamental characteristics that distinguish the propagation stability of different spatial modes. Fiber perturbations can be cast in terms of the angular momentum they impart on light. Hence the angular momentum content of eigenmodes (including their polarization states) plays a crucial role in how different modes are affected by fiber perturbations. We show that accounting for common fiber-deployment conditions including the more subtle effect of light's path memory arising from geometric Pancharatnam-Berry phases circularly polarized orbital angular momentum modes are the most stable eigenbasis for light propagation in suitably designed fibers. Aided by this stability we show a controllable wavelength-agnostic means of tailoring light's phase due to its geometric phase arising from path memory effects. We expect that these findings will help inform the optimal modal basis to use in the variety of applications that envisage using higher-order modes of optical fibers. ¬© 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH Berlin/Boston.

Simulating quantum materials with digital quantum computers;Quantum materials exhibit a wide array of exotic phenomena and practically useful properties. A better understanding of these materials can provide deeper insights into fundamental physics in the quantum realm as well as advance information processing technology and sustainability. The emergence of digital quantum computers (DQCs) which can efficiently perform quantum simulations that are otherwise intractable on classical computers provides a promising path forward for testing and analyzing the remarkable and often counter-intuitive behavior of quantum materials. Equipped with these new tools scientists from diverse domains are racing towards achieving physical quantum advantage (i.e. using a quantum computer to learn new physics with a computation that cannot feasibly be run on any classical computer). The aim of this review therefore is to provide a summary of progress made towards this goal that is accessible to scientists across the physical sciences. We will first review the available technology and algorithms and detail the myriad ways to represent materials on quantum computers. Next we will showcase the simulations that have been successfully performed on currently available DQCs emphasizing the variety of properties both static and dynamic that can be studied with this nascent technology. Finally we work through three examples of how to perform various materials simulation problems on DQCs with full code included in the supplementary material (https://stacks.iop.org/QST/6/043002/mmedia). It is our hope that this review can serve as an organized overview of progress in the field for domain experts and an accessible introduction to scientists in related fields interested in beginning to perform their own simulations of quantum materials on DQCs.  ¬© 2021 IOP Publishing Ltd.;
Transverse mode analysis for free-space laser beams using Bayesian analysis;Reliable and rapid assessment of the transverse mode quality of a free-space laser beam has a wide range of applications in laser development research and utilization. It has become even more important with recent advances in developing orbital angular momentum photon beams across a broad spectral region. In this work a general modal analysis method for a free-space multimode laser beam has been developed based on Bayesian analysis. After transforming mode decomposition into a linear system problem a Gaussian probabilistic model is used to find a closed-form solution. The method is found to be robust with the presence of Gaussian noise. Prior knowledge about the mode content can be incorporated into the method to improve the solution for situations when coherent disturbances or contamination are present in the laser beam. This method can be used to analyze the mode content for laser beams in different bases such as Hermite-Gaussian (HG) modes and Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) modes. Three applications of this method are presented: A detailed modal analysis of the beam image from the incoherent intensity addition of HG modes and two examples of mode decomposition using the complex wavefront from the coherent superposition of HG and LG modes. The feasibility of this method is demonstrated using various simulation results. Based on digital images of a laser beam recorded without complex wavelength-limiting optics in principle this method can be used in a wide wavelength range from infrared to ultraviolet and possibly x ray.  ¬© 2021 Optical Society of America.;
Local tunability in a multi-port SQUID by an injection current;The tunability in Josephson junctions is foundational to the superconducting classical and quantum applications. Here we demonstrate the local manipulation of supercurrent realized in a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) with two Nb/TiOx/Nb Josephson junctions that is biased at the TiOx layer. Our measurements indicate that the multi-port device allows for an easy and in situ tunability of the supercurrent. The control mechanism can be finely explained by simple yet valid theoretical methods which take an effective electronic temperature across the SQUID and the self inductive magnetic flux into account. Furthermore we show that the phase difference and kinetic inductance of this device can be tuned locally via the injection current. Thus the device provides perspective for several superconducting electronics such as tunable superconducting circuits sensitive magnetometry and fast digital elements. ¬© 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Securing Practical Quantum Communication Systems with Optical Power Limiters;Controlling the energy of unauthorized light signals in a quantum cryptosystem is an essential criterion for implementation security. Here we propose a passive optical power limiter device based on thermo-optical defocusing effects providing a reliable power limiting threshold that can be readily adjusted to suit various quantum applications. In addition the device is robust against a wide variety of signal variations (e.g. wavelength pulse width) which is important for implementation security. We experimentally show that the proposed device does not compromise quantum communication signals. It only has a minimal impact (if not negligible impact) on the intensity phase or polarization degrees of freedom of the photons thus making it suitable for general communication purposes. To show its practical utility for quantum cryptography we demonstrate and discuss three potential applications: (1) measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution with enhanced security against a general class of Trojan-horse attacks (2) using the power limiter as a countermeasure against bright illumination attacks and (3) the application of power limiters to potentially enhance the implementation security of plug-and-play quantum key distribution. ¬© 2021 authors.

A few research efforts have demonstrated that quantum computers which leverages the properties of quantum mechanics carries the ability to surpass classical computers in machine learning tasks. The study in this paper contributes in enabling researchers to understand how quantum computers can bring a paradigm shift in the field of machine learning. The paper focuses on the concepts of quantum computing that would be used by any machine learning technique to facilitate quantum machine learning. It also studies different quantum algorithms that could be used as core subroutines in machine learning techniques and highlights the famous Grovers algorithm. These subroutines are used to enhance the efficacy of machine learning tasks. The paper towards the end advocates the use of quantum application software and throws light on the existing challenges faced by quantum computers in the current scenario. ¬© 2021 IEEE.;
Quantum Software Models: The Density Matrix for Classical and Quantum Software Systems Design;Linear Software Models enable rigorous linear algebraic procedures for modular design of classical software systems. These procedures apply a spectral approach to matrix representations-e.g. the Laplacian-of the software system. Recent intensive research efforts towards quantum computers have increased expectations that quantum computing could in due time materialize as a practical alternative to classical computing. It is reasonable to inquire about quantum software desirable features and prepare in advance modular design procedures for quantum software systems. However it does not make sense to have two totally separate procedures for modular design one for classical software systems and another for quantum software systems. This paper claims that there should be just a single unified and rigorous design procedure for both classical and quantum software systems. Our common design procedure starting point for both classical and quantum software systems is Von Neumann's quantum notion of Density Operator and its Density Matrix representation. This paper formulates and demonstrates modular design in terms of projection operators obtained from a design Density Matrix and shows their equivalence to the Linear Software Models results of the Laplacian matrix spectrum for the classical case. The application in practice of the design procedure for both classical and quantum software is illustrated by case studies.  ¬© 2021 IEEE.;
Approximate Equivalence Checking of Noisy Quantum Circuits;We study the fundamental design automation problem of equivalence checking in the NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) computing realm where quantum noise is present inevitably. The notion of approximate equivalence of (possibly noisy) quantum circuits is defined based on the Jamiolkowski fidelity which measures the average distance between output states of two super-operators when the input is chosen at random. By employing tensor network contraction we present two algorithms aiming at different situations where the number of noises varies for computing the fidelity between an ideal quantum circuit and its noisy implementation. The effectiveness of our algorithms is demonstrated by experimenting on benchmarks of real NISQ circuits. When compared with the state-of-the-art implementation incorporated in Qiskit experimental results show that the proposed algorithms outperform in both efficiency and scalability. ¬© 2021 IEEE.;
Towards Model-Driven Quantum Software Engineering;Quantum technologies are emerging. Dedicated languages for programming Quantum machines are emerging as well and already used in different settings. Orthogonal to this development Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) is explored to ease the development of software systems by applying modeling techniques such as Domain-Specific Modeling Languages and generative techniques such as code generation. In this position paper we argue for a dedicated research line which deals with the exploration of how MDE may be applied for Quantum technologies. This combination would allow to speed-up the development of Quantum software open the door for domain experts to utilize Quantum technologies and may provide an additional abstraction layer over existing Quantum hardware architectures and programming languages. We outline several research challenges which we derived from a demonstration case of how to exploit domain-specific modeling for social network analysis on Quantum technologies.  ¬© 2021 IEEE.;
Color centers in wide-bandgap semiconductors for subdiffraction imaging: a review;Solid-state atomic-sized color centers in wide-band-gap semiconductors such as diamond silicon carbide and hexagonal boron nitride are important platforms for quantum technologies specifically for single-photon sources and quantum sensing. One of the emerging applications of these quantum emitters is subdiffraction imaging. This capability is provided by the specific photophysical properties of color centers such as high dipole moments photostability and a variety of spectral ranges of the emitters with associated optical and microwave control of their quantum states. We review applications of color centers in traditional super-resolution microscopy and quantum imaging methods and compare relative performance. The current state and perspectives of their applications in biomedical chemistry and material science imaging are outlined.  ¬© The Authors.

Variational quantum chemistry programs in jaqalpaq;We present example quantum chemistry programs written with JAQALPAQ a python meta-programming language used to code in JAQAL (Just Another Quantum Assembly Language). These JAQALPAQ algorithms are intended to be run on the Quantum Scientific Computing Open User Testbed (QSCOUT) platform at Sandia National Laboratories. Our exemplars use the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) quantum algorithm to compute the ground state energies of the H2 HeH+ and LiH molecules. Since the exemplars focus on how to program in JAQALPAQ the calculations of the second-quantized Hamiltonians are performed with the PYSCF python package and the mappings of the fermions to qubits are obtained from the OPENFERMION python package. Using the emulator functionality of JAQALPAQ we emulate how these exemplars would be executed on an error-free QSCOUT platform and compare the emulated computation of the bond-dissociation curves for these molecules with their exact forms within the relevant basis. ¬© 2021 by the authors.

Long-range qubit entanglement via rolled-up zero-index waveguide;Preservation of an entangled state in a quantum system is one of the major goals in quantum technological applications. However entanglement can be quickly lost into dissipation when the effective interaction among the qubits becomes smaller compared to the noise-injection from the environment. Thus a medium that can sustain the entanglement of distantly spaced qubits is essential for practical implementations. This work introduces the fabrication of a rolled-up zero-index waveguide which can serve as a unique reservoir for the long-range qubit-qubit entanglement. We also present the numerical evaluation of the concurrence (entanglement measure) via Ansys Lumerical FDTD simulations using the parameters determined experimentally. The calculations demonstrate the feasibility and supremacy of the experimental method. We develop and fabricate this novel structure using cost-effective self-rolling techniques. The results of this study redefine the range of light-matter interactions and show the potential of the rolled-up zero-index waveguides for various classical and quantum applications such as quantum communication quantum information processing and superradiance.  ¬© 2021 Ibrahim Issah et al. published by De Gruyter Berlin/Boston.;
Enhancement of concentration of XeV and GeV centers in microcrystalline diamond films through He+ irradiation;Atomic defect centers in diamond have been widely exploited in numerous quantum applications like quantum information sensing quantum photonics and so on. In this context there is always a requirement to improve and optimize the preparation procedure to generate the defect centers in controlled fashion and to explore new defect centers which can have the potential to overcome the current technological challenges. Through this work we report enhancing the concentration of Ge and Xe vacancy centers in microcrystalline diamond (MCD) by means of He+ irradiation. We have demonstrated controlled growth of MCD by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and implantation of Ge and Xe ions into the CVD-grown samples. MCDs were irradiated with He+ ions and characterized through optical spectroscopy measurements. Recorded photoluminescence results revealed a clear signature of enhancement of the Xe-related and Ge vacancies in MCDs. ¬© 2021 The Authors;
Exploring the Potential Benefits of Alternative Quantum Computing Architectures;Noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) computers are becoming a reality thanks to the recent advances made by researchers who physically build such systems. In order to execute corresponding quantum algorithms (usually provided in terms of quantum circuits) certain physical constraints in the architectures need to be satisfied. More precisely physical constraints restrict the possible interactions between qubits which frequently result in cases where qubits which are supposed to interact in a quantum circuit are not allowed to interact on the physical device. Thus far this is addressed by dedicated methods that map the logical quantum circuit to a physical realization and satisfy the constraints by inserting further operations. This leads to additional costs which harm the fidelity of the circuit and hence urgently need to be avoided. Unfortunately current state-of-the-art approaches for this mapping process take the existing architectures as invariant and only try to reduce the number of additionally needed operations. In contrast (slight) changes in the respectively given architectures (which still keep the underlying physical constraints satisfied) might be possible and may allow for even better (i.e. less costly) mappings. But this potential has not been investigated yet. In this work we explore this potential. More precisely we introduce several schemes for generating alternative coupling graphs (and by this quantum computing architectures) that still might be able to satisfy physical constraints but at the same time allow for a more efficient realization of the desired quantum functionality. Evaluations confirm the potential of those alternative coupling graphs and demonstrate that they can reduce the mapping overhead by up to 60% in the best case and up to almost 40% on average. ¬© 1982-2012 IEEE.;
Agile Earth Observation Satellite Scheduling with a Quantum Annealer;We present a comparison study of state-of-the-art classical optimization methods to a D-Wave 2000Q quantum annealer for the scheduling of agile Earth observation satellites. The problem is to acquire high-value images while obeying the attitude maneuvering constraint of the satellite. In order to investigate close to real-world problems we created benchmark problems by simulating realistic scenarios. Our results show that a tuned quantum annealing approach can run faster when used to find the optimal solution than a classical exact solver for some of the problem instances. Moreover we find that the solution quality of the quantum annealer is comparable to the heuristic method used operationally for small problem instances but degrades rapidly due to the limited precision of the quantum annealer.  ¬© 1965-2011 IEEE.;
Optimal Policies for Quantum Markov Decision Processes;Markov decision process (MDP) offers a general framework for modelling sequential decision making where outcomes are random. In particular it serves as a mathematical framework for reinforcement learning. This paper introduces an extension of MDP namely quantum MDP (qMDP) that can serve as a mathematical model of decision making about quantum systems. We develop dynamic programming algorithms for policy evaluation and finding optimal policies for qMDPs in the case of finite-horizon. The results obtained in this paper provide some useful mathematical tools for reinforcement learning techniques applied to the quantum world. ¬© 2021 The Author(s).;
Efficient Topology-Optimized Couplers for On-Chip Single-Photon Sources;Room-temperature single-photon sources (SPSs) are critical for emerging practical quantum applications such as on-chip photonic circuity for quantum communications systems and integrated quantum sensors. However the direct integration of an SPS into on-chip photonic systems remains challenging due to low coupling efficiencies between the SPS and the photonic circuitry that often involve size mismatch and dissimilar materials. Here we develop an adjoint topology optimization scheme to design high-efficiency couplers between a photonic waveguide and an SPS in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). The algorithm accounts for fabrication constraints and SPS location uncertainty. First a library of designs for the different positions of the hBN flake containing an SPS with respect to a Si3N4 waveguide is generated demonstrating an average coupling efficiency of 78%. Then the designs are inspected with a dimensionality reduction technique to investigate the relationship between the device geometry (topology) and the performance. The fundamental physics-based intuition gained from this approach could enable the design of high-performance quantum devices.  ¬© 2021 American Chemical Society.;
A Review of Nonmagnetic Nonreciprocal Electronic Devices: Recent advances in nonmagnetic nonreciprocal components;Reciprocity is an underlying symmetry within a physical system that dates back to the work of Green in electrostatics in 1828 [1]. Later on through the works of Helmholtz Rayleigh and Lorentz reciprocity theorems were developed in different fields such as optics acoustics elastodynamics and electromagnetics [2] [3]. The electromagnetic reciprocity theorem states that for a system with symmetrical permittivity and permeability tensors which is passive linear and time invariant the transmission and reception between two points in space are identical in opposite directions regardless of any spatial asymmetry within the channel between them. ¬© 2009-2012 IEEE.;
Virtual Logical Qubits: A Compact Architecture for Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computing;Fault-tolerant quantum computing is required to execute many of the most promising quantum applications. In recent years numerous error correcting codes such as the surface code have emerged which are well suited for current and future limited connectivity 2-D devices. We find quantum memory particularly resonant cavities with transmon qubits arranged in a 2.5-D architecture can efficiently implement surface codes with around 20√ó fewer transmons via this work. We virtualize 2-D memory addresses by storing the code in layers of qubit memories connected to each transmon. Distributing logical qubits across many memories has minimal impact on fault tolerance and results in substantially more efficient logical operations. Virtualized logical qubit (VLQ) systems can achieve fault tolerance comparable to conventional 2-D transmon-only architectures while putting within reach a proof-of-concept experimental demonstration of around ten logical qubits requiring only 11 transmons and 9 attached cavities.  ¬© 1981-2012 IEEE.;
A hash-based quantum-resistant chameleon signature scheme;As a standard digital signature may be verified by anybody it is unsuitable for personal or economically sensitive applications. The chameleon signature system was presented by Krawczyk and Rabin as a solution to this problem. It is based on a hash then sign model. The chameleon hash function enables the trapdoor information holder to compute a message digest collision. The holder of a chameleon signature is the recipient of a chameleon signature. He could compute collision on the hash value using the trapdoor information. This keeps the recipient from disclosing his conviction to a third party and ensures the privacy of the signature. The majority of the extant chameleon signature methods are built on the computationally infeasible number theory problems like integer factorization and discrete log. Unfortunately the construction of quantum computers would be rendered insecure to those schemes. This creates a solid requirement for construct chameleon signatures for the quantum world. Hence this paper proposes a novel quantum secure chameleon signature scheme based on hash functions. As a hash-based cryptosystem is an essential candidate of a post-quantum cryptosystem the proposed hash-based chameleon signature scheme would be a promising alternative to the number of theoretic-based methods. Furthermore the proposed method is key exposure-free and satisfies the security requirements such as semantic security nontransferability and unforgeability. ¬© 2021 by the authors.

Infrared metasurface-enabled compact polarization nanodevices;Infrared metasurface especially that having a working range covering wavelengths from 0.75 to 25 Œºm has been exploited as a revolutionary tool to manipulate the properties of electromagnetic waves owing to its potential applications in military and civilian fields. It owns the capacity to steer electromagnetic waves within subwavelength scale with full degrees of freedom such as phase amplitude and polarization allowing the development of a number of planar meta-devices including the metalens hologram wave-plate and polarimeter. In particular polarization which determines the interaction of electromagnetic waves with matter is important in almost every area of science. However conventional materials for infrared polarization control inevitably introduce extra optical components and bulky configurations hindering future miniaturization and integration. Moreover compared with their short wavelength counterparts polarization nanodevices in the infrared band and especially those in the long-wavelength infrared region have been far less explored due to the loss of material and immature fabrication techniques. Here we review recent progress in the development of infrared metasurfaces in terms of generating manipulating and detecting the polarization on standard and higher-order Poincar√© spheres. The principles typical strategies and emerging applications of these processes are introduced. We also discuss the challenges and outlook of future developments in this emerging field. ¬© 2021 Elsevier Ltd;
Femtosecond laser micromachining for integrated quantum photonics;Integrated quantum photonics i.e. the generation manipulation and detection of quantum states of light in integrated photonic chips is revolutionizing the field of quantum information in all applications from communications to computing. Although many different platforms are being currently developed from silicon photonics to lithium niobate photonic circuits none of them has shown the versatility of femtosecond laser micromachining (FLM) in producing all the components of a complete quantum system encompassing quantum sources reconfigurable state manipulation quantum memories and detection. It is in fact evident that FLM has been a key enabling tool in the first-time demonstration of many quantum devices and functionalities. Although FLM cannot achieve the same level of miniaturization of other platforms it still has many unique advantages for integrated quantum photonics. In particular in the last five years FLM has greatly expanded its range of quantum applications with several scientific breakthroughs achieved. For these reasons we believe that a review article on this topic is very timely and could further promote the development of this field by convincing end-users of the great potentials of this technological platform and by stimulating more research groups in FLM to direct their efforts to the exciting field of quantum technologies.  ¬© 2021 Giacomo Corrielli et al. published by De Gruyter Berlin/Boston.;

Manipulating Single-Photon Emission from Point Defects in Diamond and Silicon Carbide;Point defects in semiconductors are emerging as an important contender platform for quantum technology (QT) applications showing potential for quantum computing communication and sensing. Indeed point defects have been employed as nuclear spins for nanoscale sensing and memory in quantum registers localized electron spins for quantum bits and emitters of single photons in quantum communication and cryptography. However to utilize point defects in semiconductors as single-photon sources for QT control over the influence of the surrounding environment on the emission process must be first established. Recent works have revealed strong manipulation of emission energies and intensities via coupling of point defect wavefunctions to external factors such as electric fields strain and photonic devices. This review presents the state-of-the-art on manipulation tuning and control of single-photon emission from point defects focusing on two leading semiconductor materials‚Äîdiamond and silicon¬†carbide. ¬© 2021 The Authors.

A Fully Integrated Cryo-CMOS SoC for State Manipulation Readout and High-Speed Gate Pulsing of Spin Qubits;This article presents a fully integrated Cryo-CMOS system on chip (SoC) for quantum computing. The proposed SoC integrates a radio frequency (RF) pulse modulator for qubit state manipulation a multi-tone signal generator and a coherent receiver for qubit state readout and 22 DACs for high-speed voltage pulsing of qubit gates. By adopting frequency division multiplexing and direct digital synthesis (DDS) the RF pulse modulator can control up to 16 qubits over a single RF line and the readout receiver can detect the state of up to six qubits simultaneously. The proposed SoC also integrates a microcontroller for low latency on-chip signal processing and increased flexibility in implementing quantum instruction sets. A detailed analysis of qubit-state readout fidelity and the impact of finite DAC resolution on two-qubit gate fidelity is also included in this article together with an electrical specification summary. The SoC is implemented in Intel's 22 nm FFL fin field-effect transistor (FinFET) process and it is characterized both at room and 4 K temperatures. The performance of each specific block is measured with the readout characterized in a loop-back configuration. Generation of the control signals required for a full Rabi oscillation experiment is also demonstrated. This article also describes the cryogenic thermalization techniques used to integrate the SoC in the dilution refrigerator and shows temperature measurements during operation.  ¬© 1966-2012 IEEE.;
Guest editorial: Selected extended papers from the Quantum Software Architecture Workshop at IEEE International Conference on Software Architecture 2021 (ICSA 2021);Conditions of breaking down the structural stability of a spiral vortex beam subject to sector perturbations were considered. Employing methods of computer simulation and processing experimental results we have shown that the spiral vortex beam has a caustic surface the intersection of which sharply changes a shape of the Poynting vector streamlines and critical points of the spiral beam. Nevertheless the beam propagation (scaling and rotation) does not change the perturbed streamline‚Äôs shape and phase pattern. We also revealed that strong beam perturbations can cause the conversion of the circulation direction of streamlines in the perturbation region which entails the appearance of a network of optical vortices with negative topological charges. However the beam‚Äôs orbital angular momentum remains unchanging despite increasing the information entropy (growing a number of vortex modes) so that the perturbed beam keeps new stable states. ¬© 2021 Optical Society of America;
Neural-Network Heuristics for Adaptive Bayesian Quantum Estimation;Quantum metrology promises unprecedented measurement precision but suffers in practice from the limited availability of resources such as the number of probes their coherence time or nonclassical quantum states. The adaptive Bayesian approach to parameter estimation allows an efficient use of resources because of adaptive experiment design. For its practical success fast numerical solutions for the Bayesian update and the adaptive experiment design are crucial. Here we show that neural networks can be trained to become fast and strong experiment-design heuristics using a combination of an evolutionary strategy and reinforcement learning. Neural-network heuristics are shown to outperform established heuristics for the technologically important example of frequency estimation of a qubit that suffers from dephasing. Our method of creating neural-network heuristics is very general and complements the well-studied sequential Monte Carlo method for Bayesian updates to form a complete framework for adaptive Bayesian quantum estimation.  ¬© 2021 authors.

On Applications of Dependent Types to Parameterised Digital Signal Processing Circuits;We explore the use of dependent types to address the disparity between the theory and the practical hardware description of DSP circuits. After discussing an approach to modeling synchronous circuit behaviour in Idris (a pure functional language with dependent types) two DSP case studies are introduced - an FIR filter with optimal wordlengths and a CIC decimator with register pruning. Both of these scenarios prove difficult to describe in a parameterised fashion using traditional HDLs and as such many implementations rely on ad hoc circuit generators which are challenging to test and evaluate. This work demonstrates that such circuits are readily described in an environment with dependent types. Dependent types can also encode various contracts between the IP designer and its user. These contracts are automatically verified by the Idris type checker before compilation precluding many common mistakes in IP development and evaluation.  ¬© 2021 IEEE.;
High-Resolution High-Contrast Optical Interface for Defect Qubits;Point defects in crystals provide important building blocks for quantum applications. Since we optically address these defect qubits having an efficient optical interface is a highly important aspect. However conventional confocal fluorescence microscopy of high-refractive-index crystals suffers from limited photon collection efficiency and spatial resolution. Here we demonstrate high-resolution high-contrast imaging of defects in diamonds using microsphere-assisted confocal microscopy. A microsphere provides an excellent optical interface for point defects with a magnified virtual image that increases the spatial resolution up to Œª/5 as well as the optical signal-to-noise ratio by four times. These features enable individual optical addressing of single photons and single spins of multiple defects that are spatially unresolved in conventional confocal microscopy with improved signal contrast. Combined with optical tweezers this system also demonstrates the possibility of positioning or scanning the microspheres. The approach does not require any complicated fabrication or additional optical systems but uses simple off-the-shelf micro-optics. From these distinctive advantages of microspheres our approach provides an efficient way to image and address closely spaced defects with much better resolution and sensitivity. ¬© 2021 The Authors.

Bhattacharyya parameter of monomial codes for the binary erasure channel: From pointwise to average reliability;Monomial codes were recently equipped with partial order relations a fact that allowed researchers to discover structural properties and efficient algorithm for constructing polar codes. Here we refine the existing order relations in the particular case of the binary erasure channel. The new order relation takes us closer to the ultimate order relation induced by the pointwise evaluation of the Bhattacharyya parameter of the synthetic channels which is still a partial order relation. To overcome this issue we appeal to a related technique from network theory. Reliability network theory was recently used in the context of polar coding and more generally in connection with decreasing monomial codes. In this article we investigate how the concept of average reliability is applied for polar codes designed for the binary erasure channel. Instead of minimizing the error probability of the synthetic channels for a particular value of the erasure parameter p our codes minimize the average error probability of the synthetic channels. By means of basic network theory results we determine a closed formula for the average reliability of a particular synthetic channel that recently gain the attention of researchers. ¬© 2020 by the authors.

Fast Simulation of Bosonic Qubits via Gaussian Functions in Phase Space;Bosonic qubits are a promising route to building fault-tolerant quantum computers on a variety of physical platforms. Studying the performance of bosonic qubits under realistic gates and measurements is challenging with existing analytical and numerical tools. We present a novel formalism for simulating classes of states that can be represented as linear combinations of Gaussian functions in phase space. This formalism allows us to analyze and simulate a wide class of non-Gaussian states transformations and measurements. We demonstrate how useful classes of bosonic qubits - Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) cat and Fock states - can be simulated using this formalism opening the door to investigating the behavior of bosonic qubits under Gaussian channels and measurements non-Gaussian transformations such as those achieved via gate teleportation and important non-Gaussian measurements such as threshold and photon-number detection. Our formalism enables simulating these situations with levels of accuracy that are not feasible with existing methods. Finally we use a method informed by our formalism to simulate circuits critical to the study of fault-tolerant quantum computing with bosonic qubits but beyond the reach of existing techniques. Specifically we examine how finite-energy GKP states transform under realistic qubit phase gates interface with a continuous-variable cluster state and transform under non-Clifford t gate teleportation using magic states. We implement our simulation method as a part of the open-source Strawberry Fields python library. ¬© 2021 authors.;

Multi-Watt 1-GHz CMOS Circulator Based on Switched-Capacitor Clock Boosting;There has been significant recent progress in the implementation of integrated non-reciprocal components based on linear periodically time-varying (LPTV) circuits. Nevertheless integrated circulators still require a leap forward in power handling clock power consumption and insertion loss (IL) to become compelling compared with ferrite circulators or integrated reciprocal alternatives such as the electrical-balance duplexer (EBD). This article introduces three innovations: 1) a new switched-capacitor clock-boosting scheme 2) high-Bragg-frequency quasi-distributed transmission lines based on periodically loaded inductors and 3) a new gyrator based on switched partially reflecting t-lines - which enable significant performance improvement for integrated circulators and for LPTV circuits more broadly. These are showcased in a 1-GHz 180-nm SOI CMOS circulator that exhibits 2.1-/2.6-dB TX-ANT/ANT-RX IL (0.3 dB better than prior art) +34-dBm TX-ANT P1 dB (2.5 √ó or 4 dB better) and 40% lower chip area all at 39-mW power consumption (4.4 √ó lower).  ¬© 1966-2012 IEEE.;

QDiff: Differential Testing of Quantum Software Stacks;Over the past few years several quantum software stacks (QSS) have been developed in response to rapid hardware advances in quantum computing. A QSS includes a quantum programming language an optimizing compiler that translates a quantum algorithm written in a high-level language into quantum gate instructions a quantum simulator that emulates these instructions on a classical device and a software controller that sends analog signals to a very expensive quantum hardware based on quantum circuits. In comparison to traditional compilers and architecture simulators QSSes are difficult to tests due to the probabilistic nature of results the lack of clear hardware specifications and quantum programming complexity.This work devises a novel differential testing approach for QSSes named QDiff with three major innovations: (1) We generate input programs to be tested via semantics-preserving source to source transformation to explore program variants. (2) We speed up differential testing by filtering out quantum circuits that are not worthwhile to execute on quantum hardware by analyzing static characteristics such as a circuit depth 2-gate operations gate error rates and T1 relaxation time. (3) We design an extensible equivalence checking mechanism via distribution comparison functions such as Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and cross entropy.We evaluate QDiff with three widely-used open source QSSes: Qiskit from IBM Cirq from Google and Pyquil from Rigetti. By running QDiff on both real hardware and quantum simulators we found several critical bugs revealing potential instabilities in these platforms. QDiff's source transformation is effective in producing semantically equivalent yet not-identical circuits (i.e. 34% of trials) and its filtering mechanism can speed up differential testing by 66%.  ¬© 2021 IEEE.;
Quantum Semantic Learning by Reverse Annealing of an Adiabatic Quantum Computer;Restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) constitute a class of neural networks for unsupervised learning with applications ranging from pattern classification to quantum state reconstruction. Despite the potential representative power the diffusion of RBMs is quite limited since their training process proves to be hard. The advent of commercial adiabatic quantum computers (AQCs) raised the expectation that the implementations of RBMs on such quantum devices can increase the training speed with respect to conventional hardware. Here the feasibility of a complete RBM on AQCs is demonstrated thanks to an embedding that associates the nodes of the neural networks to virtual qubits. A semantic quantum search is implemented thanks to a reverse annealing schedule. Such an approach exploits more information from the training data mimicking the behavior of the classical Gibbs sampling algorithm. The semantic training is shown to quickly raise the sampling probability of a subset of the set of the configurations. Even without a proper optimization of the annealing schedule the RBM semantically trained achieves good scores on reconstruction tasks. The development of such techniques paves the way toward the establishment of a quantum advantage of adiabatic quantum computers especially given the foreseen improvement of such¬†hardware. ¬© 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH;
Performance of Domain-Wall Encoding for Quantum Annealing;In this article we experimentally test the performance of the recently proposed domain-wall encoding of discrete variables Chancellor 2019 on Ising model flux qubit quantum annealers. We compare this encoding with the traditional one-hot methods and find that they outperform the one-hot encoding for three different problems at different sizes of both the problem and the variables. From these results we conclude that the domain-wall encoding yields superior performance against a variety of metrics furthermore we do not find a single metric by which one hot performs better. We even find that a 2000Q quantum annealer with a drastically less connected hardware graph but using the domain-wall encoding can outperform the next-generation Advantage processor if that processor uses one-hot encoding. ¬© 2021 by the Author(s).;
Error Analysis of the Variational Quantum Eigensolver Algorithm;Variational quantum algorithms have been one of the most intensively studied applications for near-term quantum computing applications. The noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) regime where small enough algorithms can be run successfully on noisy quantum computers expected during the next 5 years is driving both a large amount of research work and a significant amount of private sector funding. Therefore it is important to understand whether variational algorithms are effective at successfully converging to the correct answer in presence of noise. We perform a comprehensive study of the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) and its individual quantum subroutines. Building on asymptotic bounds we show through explicit simulation that the VQE algorithm effectively collapses already when single errors occur during a quantum processing call. We discuss the significant implications of this result in the context of being able to run any variational type algorithm without resource expensive error correction protocols. ¬© 2021 IEEE.;

Drone-based quantum key distribution (QKD);Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are used in numerous applications ranging from defense law enforcement environmental monitoring disaster recovery aerial photography and delivering consumer packages. Securing wireless communication between drones in-flight is critical to ensure safe operation during flight and avoid multiple types of attacks e.g. eavesdropping spoofing jamming etc. Quantum communication protocols offer enhancements over classical approaches. In this effort we present progress towards demonstrating Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) between two drones in flight. A significant challenge includes achieving system performance using compact Size Weight and Power (SWaP) constraints of the drone vehicle.

Overcoming the Tradeoff between Accuracy and Compactness in Decision Diagrams for Quantum Computation;Quantum computation promises to solve many hard or infeasible problems substantially faster than classical solutions. The involvement of big players like Google IBM Intel Rigetti or Microsoft furthermore led to a momentum which increases the demand for automated design methods for quantum computations. In this context decision diagrams for quantum computation provide a major pillar as they allow to efficiently represent quantum states and quantum operations which otherwise have to be described in terms of exponentially large state vectors and unitary matrices. However current decision diagrams for the quantum domain suffer from a tradeoff between accuracy and compactness since: 1) small errors that are inevitably introduced by the limited precision of floating-point arithmetic can harm the compactness (i.e. the size of the decision diagram) significantly and 2) overcompensating these errors (to increase compactness) may lead to an information loss and introduces numerical instabilities. In this article we describe and evaluate the effects of this tradeoff which clearly motivates the need for a solution that is perfectly accurate and compact at the same time. More precisely we show that the tradeoff indeed weakens current design automation approaches for quantum computation (possibly leading to corrupted results or infeasible run-times). To overcome this we propose an alternative approach that utilizes an algebraic representation of the occurring complex and irrational numbers and outline how this can be incorporated in a decision diagram which is suited for quantum computation. Evaluations show that - at the cost of an overhead which is moderate in many cases - the proposed algebraic solution indeed overcomes the tradeoff between accuracy and compactness that is present in current numerical solutions.  ¬© 1982-2012 IEEE.;
Evolution of defects morphologies and fundamental growth characteristics of CVD diamond films induced by nitrogen addition;Diamond is a very promising material with exceptional properties for many high value-added applications especially due to the incorporation of impurities. As one of the most important impurities nitrogen is widely found in natural and synthetic diamonds and the control of nitrogen-related defects in diamond is definitely at the spotlight for its potentials in room temperature quantum applications. Since chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is one of the most promising techniques for diamond doping and realization of defect control it is thus crucial to investigate the nitrogen impurities in as-grown CVD diamond. In this work single-crystal diamonds were grown with different nitrogen concentration and the evolution of defects morphologies and fundamental growth characteristics of the CVD diamond films was explored by various modern analysis and detection methods. It could be concluded that the introduction of nitrogen could result in an evident increase in supersaturation of the growth radicals at the growth interface which would eventually distinctly promote the (100)-oriented diamond growth. In consequence single-crystal diamonds of high crystalline quality and few carbonaceous impurities could be achieved at high growth rates with appropriate amounts of nitrogen addition. As the nitrogen concentration increased the structure and content of the defects would evolve as well with the domination of point defects probably leading to lattice deformation in the as-grown diamond films. The surface morphologies of the nitrogen-doped CVD diamond films could also be distinctly altered with the compromise between the development of step bunching process and the occurrence of two-dimensional growth which would eventually lead to variations of the surface roughness and uniformity of the as-grown diamond films. ¬© 2020 Elsevier Ltd;

Reconfigurable chalcogenide phase change metamaterials: A material device and fabrication perspective;Chalcogenide phase change semiconductors have played a crucial role in the evolution of photonic technologies.

Strain Modulation of Si Vacancy Emission from SiC Micro- And Nanoparticles;Single-photon emitting point defects in semiconductors have emerged as strong candidates for future quantum technology devices. In the present work we exploit crystalline particles to investigate relevant defect localizations emission shifting and waveguiding. Specifically emission from 6H-SiC micro- and nanoparticles ranging from 100 nm to 5 Œºm in size is collected using cathodoluminescence (CL) and we monitor signals attributed to the Si vacancy (VSi) as a function of its location. Clear shifts in the emission wavelength are found for emitters localized in the particle center and at the edges. By comparing spatial CL maps with strain analysis carried out in transmission electron microscopy we attribute the emission shifts to compressive strain of 2-3% along the particle a-direction. Thus embedding VSi qubit defects within SiC nanoparticles offers an interesting and versatile opportunity to tune single-photon emission energies while simultaneously ensuring ease of addressability via a self-assembled SiC nanoparticle matrix.  ¬© 2020 American Chemical Society.;

Four-wave mixing in high-Q tellurium-oxide-coated silicon nitride microring resonators;We report the first-time observation to the best of our knowledge of four-wave mixing (FWM) in hybrid tellurium oxide coated silicon nitride ring resonators with internal Q factors of 1.7 √ó 105 to 1.0 √ó 106. We show oscillation at NIR wavelengths ranging from 1020 nm to 2530 nm under 1590 nm pumping. The FWM process has been investigated for TeO2-coated Si3N4 ring resonators with a 600 ¬µm radius and FWM is observed for threshold launched pump powers as low as 25 mW with normal group velocity dispersion (GVD). With the potential for engineering of the GVD to the anomalous regime a phase-matched and more efficient FWM process can be realized which can pave the way for broadband frequency comb generation in this platform. These results suggest further promise of higher performance and lower threshold power nonlinear devices on a low-loss CMOS compatible platform with the possibility of co-integration of active functionalities due to high solubility of rare earth dopants in tellurium oxide. ¬© 2020 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement.;
Cross-nanofin-based waveplate pixels for broadband hybrid polarization coding in nearfield;As an inherent characteristic of light polarization plays important roles in information storage display and even encryption. Metasurfaces composed of specifically designed subwavelength units in a twodimensional plane offer a great convenience for polarization manipulation yet improving their integrability and broadband fidelity remain significant challenges. Here based on the combination of various subwavelength cross-nanofins (CNs) a new type of metasurface for multichannel hybrid polarization distribution in nearfield is proposed. Sub-wavelength CN units with various waveplate (WP) functionalities such as frequencydivision multiplexing WP half-WP and quarter-WP are implemented with high efficiency in broadband. Highresolution grayscale image encryption multi-image storage and rapid polarization detection are demonstrated by encoding the WP pixels into single double and four channels respectively. All these applications possess good fidelity in an ultrabroad wavelength band from1.2 to 1.9 Œºm and the high degree of integrability easy fabrication andmultifunctionmake the CN-shapedWP pixels a promising candidate in optical device miniaturization quantum applications and imaging technologies. ¬© 2021 Shuo Du et al.;
OSCAR-QUBE: Integrated Diamond-Based Quantum Magnetic Field Sensor for Space Applications;The diverse application opportunities high sensitivity precision and the enabling of various measurement protocols have raised the attention of novel quantum sensing methods. One of the promising quantum sensing platforms nowadays is the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centre an opto-magnetic defect located in the diamond's crystalline lattice that can be exploited as a solid-state qubit at room temperature. The combination of diamond and NV centres make it an ideal candidate for magnetic field sensing in harsh conditions as well as a steppingstone to bring quantum technology to everyday use with numerous applications in the field of geophysics healthcare and aerospace. The OSCAR-QUBE team consists of 13 interdisciplinary students who developed a portable NV-diamond based quantum magnetometer for space applications. The project was selected for the 'Orbit Your Thesis!' programme organised by the European Space Agency in April 2020. With this the team had won the opportunity to send their device to the International Space Station (ISS). In September 2021 the device was successfully commissioned onboard the ISS. This work aims to describe the results of the OSCAR-QUBE mission which is proving the viability of this novel technology in a space environment by collecting magnetic field data in Low Earth Orbit in order to construct a magnetic field map of the Earth.

Reliability Testing Noise And Error Correction Of Real Quantum Computing Devices;From Pharmacology to Cryptography and from Geology to Astronomy are some of the scientific fields in which Quantum Computing potentially will take off and fly high. Big Quantum Computing vendors invest a large amount of money in improving the hardware and they claim that soon enough a quantum program will be hundreds of thousands of times faster than a typical one we know nowadays. But still the reliability of such systems is the main obstacle. In this work the reliability of real quantum devices is tested and techniques of noise and error correction are presented while measurement error mitigation is explored. In addition a wellknown string matching algorithm (Bernstein‚ÄìVazirani) was applied to the real quantum computing device in order to measure its accuracy and reliability. Simulated environments were also used in order to evaluate the results. The results obtained even if these were not 100% accurate are very promising which proves that even these days a quantum computer working side by side with a typical one is reliable and especially when error mitigation techniques are applied. ¬© 2021Telfor Journal.

A study of the rotational spin-Hall effect in higher order Gaussian beams;Spin-to-orbit conversion of light is a dynamical optical phenomenon in a non-paraxial fields which plays an important role in various manifestations of the optical Hall Effect. Here we demonstrate-both theoretically and experimentally-the rotational Hall Effect for a higher order Gaussian beam (HG10) in an optical tweezers configuration. Our theoretical results clearly reveal that for an input spin polarized HG10 mode (right/left circularly polarized) the orthogonal circularly polarized component (left/ right) generated due to angular momentum conservation following spin-orbit interaction displays a large rotation of the intensity profile-a clear signature of the rotational Hall effect. We demonstrate the same experimentally although the impossibility of separating out the longitudinal component from the detected intensity profile prevents us from obtaining rotation values as large as the theoretical predictions. We also measure the rotational shift as a function of the refractive index contrast in the beam path of the optical tweezers and observe a proportional increase in general. We envisage interesting applications in inducing complex dynamics in optically trapped birefringent particles due to the spin-orbit conversion in our system.  ¬© COPYRIGHT SPIE.

Estimating algorithmic information using quantum computing for genomics applications;Inferring algorithmic structure in data is essential for discovering causal generative models. In this research we present a quantum computing framework using the circuit model for estimating algorithmic information metrics. The canonical computation model of the Turing machine is restricted in time and space resources to make the target metrics computable under realistic assumptions. The universal prior distribution for the automata is obtained as a quantum superposition which is further conditioned to estimate the metrics. Specific cases are explored where the quantum implementation offers polynomial advantage in contrast to the exhaustive enumeration needed in the corresponding classical case. The unstructured output data and the computational irreducibility of Turing machines make this algorithm impossible to approximate using heuristics. Thus exploring the space of program-output relations is one of the most promising problems for demonstrating quantum supremacy using Grover search that cannot be dequantized. Experimental use cases for quantum acceleration are developed for self-replicating programs and algorithmic complexity of short strings. With quantum computing hardware rapidly attaining technological maturity we discuss how this framework will have significant advantage for various genomics applications in meta-biology phylogenetic tree analysis protein-protein interaction mapping and synthetic biology. This is the first time experimental algorithmic information theory is implemented using quantum computation.

Remote Phonon Control of Quantum Dots and Other Artificial Atoms;To exploit the full potential of chips for quantum technologies it is worth considering all possible opportunities offered by the solid state. The aspect covered in this article is the use of phononic fields to remotely influence the optical properties of artificial atoms. The three most commonly used strain sources are discussed that is mechanical resonators surface acoustic waves and picosecond acoustic pulses. All three platforms are routinely interfaced with quantum dots and other qubits in basic research which renders a first step toward large scale implementation in quantum applications. A central question regarding the interaction between lattice oscillations and the optically active artificial atoms deals with the characteristic time scales of the two components. The influence of this aspect on the expected optical response on the phononic driving is discussed. Besides well known semiconducting quantum dots and color centers that typically operate in the visible spectral range the more recently discovered artificial atoms in layered van der Waals materials are discussed. Due to their flexibility and robustness these crystals promise vast opportunities for future applications. Another important building block lies in superconducting qubits that allow to resonantly generate quantum phonon states and therefore establish the field of quantum¬†acoustics. ¬© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH;
Quantum Circuit Transformation Based on Simulated Annealing and Heuristic Search;Quantum algorithm design usually assumes access to a perfect quantum computer with ideal properties like full connectivity noise-freedom and arbitrarily long coherence time. In noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices however the number of qubits is highly limited and quantum operation error and qubit coherence are not negligible. Besides the connectivity of physical qubits in a quantum processing unit (QPU) is also strictly constrained. Thereby additional operations like SWAP gates have to be inserted to satisfy this constraint while preserving the functionality of the original circuit. This process is known as quantum circuit transformation. Adding additional gates will increase both the size and depth of a quantum circuit and therefore cause further decay of the performance of a quantum circuit. Thus it is crucial to minimize the number of added gates. In this article we propose an efficient method to solve this problem. We first choose by using simulated annealing an initial mapping which fits well with the input circuit and then with the help of a heuristic cost function stepwise apply the best-selected SWAP gates until all quantum gates in the circuit can be executed. Our algorithm runs in time polynomial in all parameters including the size and the qubit number of the input circuit and the qubit number in the QPU. Its space complexity is quadratic to the number of edges in the QPU. The experimental results on extensive realistic circuits confirm that the proposed method is efficient and the number of added gates of our algorithm is on average only 57% of that of state-of-the-art algorithms on IBM Q20 (Tokyo) the most recent IBM quantum device.  ¬© 1982-2012 IEEE.;

Request Scheduling in Quantum Networks;Quantum networking is emerging as a new research area to explore the opportunities of interconnecting quantum systems through end-to-end entanglement of qubits at geographical distance via quantum repeaters. A promising architecture has been proposed in the literature that decouples entanglement between adjacent quantum nodes/repeaters from establishing end-to-end paths by adopting a time slotted approach. Within this model we destructure further end-to-end path establishment into two subproblems: path selection and scheduling. The former is set to determine the best repeaters to connect two end nodes provided that all their local entanglements have succeeded. On the other hand scheduling is concerned with deciding which pairs of end nodes are served in the current time slot while the others remain queued for later time slots. Unlike path selection scheduling has not been investigated so far in the literature particularly in presence of quantum noise which makes both problems even more challenging. In this article we propose to address it via a general framework of heuristic algorithms for which we propose three illustrative instances with the objective of keeping the application delay small while achieving a good system utilization in terms of high entanglement rate and fidelity of remotely entangled qubits. The system proposed is evaluated extensively via event-driven quantum network simulations with noisy repeaters in different node topologies under a Poisson arrival of requests from quantum applications. The results show the existence of a fundamental tradeoff between system- and application-level metrics such as fairness versus entanglement and fidelity which lays the foundations for further studies in this thriving research area. ¬© 2021 by the Author(s).;
A Uniform Quantum Computing Model based on Virtual Quantum Processors;What else than Hybrid Quantum Computing will dominate data centers just within a decade? But until now it is unclear how precisely such high-performance computers will be constructed even the fundamental functionality is in question. Thus it is very hard to prepare today from a programmer perspective in-depth for the anticipated near-term programming paradigm shift due to quantum computers. Furthermore the industry is reluctant to invest heavily into quantum software development right now since under this uncertainty regarding the future development of hardware and Cloud services no one would like to see all these efforts to be ruined by a novel technology an unforeseen new machine which would eradicate the software in place which the industry had developed so costly. This calls for a more generic view on Hybrid Quantum Computing on one hand hardware agnostic but still anticipating the fundamental laws of nature which rule any future quantum computing system regardless of its engineered excellence. This generalization can be done with the introduction of a Virtual Quantum Processor a piece of imaginary hardware which is described detailed enough to emulate a generic hybrid quantum machine based on a set of instructions within a Turing machine. If this could be accomplished we would retrieve a Uniform Computing Model for Hybrid Quantum Software which can be applied later to any physical representation of quantum computing hardware but would run already today on our current machines. ¬© 2021 IEEE.;

Understanding quantum control processor capabilities and limitations through circuit characterization;Continuing the scaling of quantum computers hinges on building classical control hardware pipelines that are scalable extensible and provide real time response. The instruction set architecture (ISA) of the control processor provides functional abstractions that map high-level semantics of quantum programming languages to low-level pulse generation by hardware. In this paper we provide a methodology to quantitatively assess the effectiveness of the ISA to encode quantum circuits for intermediate-scale quantum devices with O(102) qubits. The characterization model that we define reflects performance the ability to meet timing constraint implications scalability for future quantum chips and other important considerations making them useful guides for future designs. Using our methodology we propose scalar (QUASAR) and vector (qV) quantum ISAs as extensions and compare them with other ISAs in metrics such as circuit encoding efficiency the ability to meet real-time gate cycle requirements of quantum chips and the ability to scale to more qubits. ¬© 2020 International Conference on Rebooting Computing (ICRC);
Assertion-based optimization of Quantum programs;Quantum computers promise to perform certain computations exponentially faster than any classical device. Precise control over their physical implementation and proper shielding from unwanted interactions with the environment become more difficult as the space/time volume of the computation grows. Code optimization is thus crucial in order to reduce resource requirements to the greatest extent possible. Besides manual optimization previous work has adapted classical methods such as constant-folding and common subexpression elimination to the quantum domain. However such classically-inspired methods fail to exploit certain optimization opportunities across subroutine boundaries limiting the effectiveness of software reuse. To address this insufficiency we introduce an optimization methodology which employs annotations that describe how subsystems are entangled in order to exploit these optimization opportunities. We formalize our approach prove its correctness and present benchmarks: Without any prior manual optimization our methodology is able to reduce e.g. the qubit requirements of a 64-bit floating-point subroutine by 34√ó. ¬© 2020 Owner/Author.;
Cryo-CMOS compact modeling;This paper highlights some of the challenges faced for the modeling of MOSFET devices for operation at cryogenic temperature (CT). A special focus is given on the modeling of the threshold voltage VT and the subthreshold swing SS. The significant increase of VT at CT reduces the available overdrive voltage and therefore needs to be modeled properly. The SS saturates to a constant value below a critical temperature Tc of typically 40 K. This mitigates the current saving that could be expected from reducing the temperature since the transconductance for a given current does not scale inversely with 1/T below Tc. A correct modeling of these two phenomena is therefore key for developing an improved compact model (CM) that scales with T from RT down to CT. ¬© 2020 IEEE.;
Understanding Quantum Software Engineering Challenges An Empirical Study on Stack Exchange Forums and GitHub Issues;With the advance of quantum computing quantum software becomes critical for exploring the full potential of quantum computing systems. Recently quantum software engineering (QSE) becomes an emerging area attracting more and more attention. However it is not clear what are the challenges and opportunities of quantum computing facing the software engineering community. This work aims to understand the QSE-related challenges perceived by developers. We perform an empirical study on Stack Exchange forums where developers post-QSE-related questions answers and Github issue reports where developers raise QSE-related issues in practical quantum computing projects. Based on an existing taxonomy of question types on Stack Overflow we first perform a qualitative analysis of the types of QSE-related questions asked on Stack Exchange forums. We then use automated topic modeling to uncover the topics in QSE-related Stack Exchange posts and GitHub issue reports. Our study highlights some particularly challenging areas of QSE that are different from that of traditional software engineering such as explaining the theory behind quantum computing code interpreting quantum program outputs and bridging the knowledge gap between quantum computing and classical computing as well as their associated opportunities.  ¬© 2021 IEEE.;
Machine Learning for Integrated Quantum Photonics;Realization of integrated quantum photonics is a key step toward scalable quantum applications such as quantum computing sensing information processing and quantum material metrology. To enable practical quantum photonic systems several challenges should be addressed including (i) the realization of deterministic bright and stable single-photon emission operating at THz rates and at room temperatures (ii) on-chip integration of efficient single-photon sources and (iii) the development of deterministic and scalable nanoassembly of quantum circuitry elements. In this Perspective we focus on the emerging field of physics-informed machine learning (ML) quantum photonics that is envisioned to play a decisive role in addressing the above challenges. Specifically three directions of ML-assisted quantum research are discussed: (i) rapid preselection of single single-photon sources via ML-assisted quantum measurements (ii) hybrid ML-optimization approach for developing efficient quantum circuits elements and (iii) ML-based frameworks for developing novel deterministic assembly of on-chip quantum emitters.  ¬© ;
Application of Combinatorial Testing to Quantum Programs;The capability of Quantum Computing (QC) in solving complex problems has been increasingly recognized. However similar to classical computing to fully exploit QC's potential it is important to ensure the correctness of quantum programs. Doing so via software testing is however very challenging because of QC's inherent properties: superposition and entanglement. Towards the direction of ensuring the correctness of quantum programs we propose an approach called QuCAT (QUantum CombinAtorial Testing) for systematic and automated testing of quantum programs by benefiting from combinatorial testing which has been proven to be cost-effective in testing classical programs. QuCAT supports two combinatorial test suite generation scenarios i.e. generating combinatorial test suites of a given strength and incrementally generating and executing combinatorial test suites of increasing strength until a fault is found. The approach employs two types of test oracles to assess test results. We performed an empirical study with 18 faulty versions of quantum programs to evaluate QuCAT with strengths of two three and four in the two test generation scenarios. We compare the cost-effectiveness of combinatorial testing of various strengths and random testing (taken as baseline approach). Results show that combinatorial testing always performs better than random testing with the same cost and finds faults more quickly (in terms of required number of test cases). In addition in most cases combinatorial testing with a higher strength outperforms the lower strength in terms of effectiveness. ¬© 2021 IEEE.;
Impact of dangling bonds on properties of h-BN;Hexagonal boron nitride is a promising host for quantum defects with several single-photon emitters having been observed. In the visible spectrum the observed single-photon emitters are notoriously heterogeneous exhibiting a range of properties. To harness these emitters for quantum applications identification and characterization of the responsible defects are of paramount importance. Towards this end we characterize the effects of out-of-plane displacements on boron dangling bonds which have been suggested as the microscopic origin of the emission. We find that the out-of-plane displacements influence the zero-phonon line energy as well as the coupling to phonons. We compute the radiative lifetime of the emission which is in agreement with the experimental value. ¬© 2021 IOP Publishing Ltd;

All-dielectric chiral coding metasurface based on spin-decoupling in terahertz band;Metamaterials can achieve superior electromagnetic properties over natural materials by adjusting the structure of the meta-atoms. Chiral metamaterials have been widely used in circular dichroism (CD) spectra polarization imaging and optical sensing. Here we propose a kind of all-silicon coding metasurfaces to achieve the function similar to chirality by spin decoupling. One of the two circularly polarized (CP) channels is scattered randomly and the desired function is only designed in the other opposite CP channel. Three kinds of coding metasurfaces are designed to verify the reliability of such approach: one simultaneously possessing dual function of transmitting directly and scattering randomly one capable of generating the superposition state of vortex beam and the other generating the Bessel vortex beam respectively. And some experimental verifications are carried out. This scheme is simpler and more versatile than previous schemes which require elaborate designed structure of the meta-atoms. Our novel approach provides a new option for implementing tunable chirality. ¬© 2021 De Gruyter. All rights reserved.;
Muskit: A Mutation Analysis Tool for Quantum Software Testing;Given that quantum software testing is a new area of research there is a lack of benchmark programs and bugs repositories to assess the effectiveness of testing techniques. To this end quantum mutation analysis focuses on systematically generating faulty versions of Quantum Programs (QPs) called mutants using mutation operators. Such mutants can be used as benchmarks to assess the quality of test cases in a test suite. Thus we present Muskit - a quantum mutation analysis tool for QPs coded in IBM's Qiskit language. Muskit defines mutation operators on gates of QPs and selection criteria to reduce the number of mutants to generate. Moreover it allows for the execution of test cases on mutants and generation of results for test analyses. Muskit is provided as command line interface GUI and web application. We validated Muskit by using it to generate and execute mutants for four QPs.

Enabling accuracy-aware Quantum compilers using symbolic resource estimation;Approximation errors must be taken into account when compiling quantum programs into a low-level gate set. We present a methodology that tracks such errors automatically and then optimizes accuracy parameters to guarantee a specified overall accuracy while aiming to minimize the implementation cost in terms of quantum gates. The core idea of our approach is to extract functions that specify the optimization problem directly from the high-level description of the quantum program. Then custom compiler passes optimize these functions turning them into (near-)symbolic expressions for (1) the total error and (2) the implementation cost (e.g. total quantum gate count). All unspecified parameters of the quantum program will show up as variables in these expressions including accuracy parameters. After solving the corresponding optimization problem a circuit can be instantiated from the found solution. We develop two prototype implementations one in C++ based on Clang/LLVM and another using the Q# compiler infrastructure. We benchmark our prototypes on typical quantum computing programs including the quantum Fourier transform quantum phase estimation and Shor's algorithm. ¬© 2020 Owner/Author.;
Preliminary characterisation of titanium nitride thin film at 300 mK for the development of kinetic inductance travelling wave parametric amplifiers;Travelling wave parametric amplifiers (TWPAs) made from highly nonlinear reactive superconducting thin films have been demonstrated to be a viable technology for various quantum applications including fundamental physics experiments such as astronomy and axion dark matter searches as well as commercial applications like quantum computational and communication systems. In this paper we present the design of a kinetic inductance TWPA comprising a patterned titanium nitride film that can operate at 0.3K to demonstrate the feasibility of operation closer to 1K temperature paving the way to achieve even higher bath temperature operation. We discuss in detail the design of our TWPA along with the predicted gain-bandwidth product and other characteristics. We perform the preliminary experimental investigation of the thin film properties and compare that with the simulated results. We found that there are several discrepancies between the measured and the predicted behaviour of the thin film. We attribute these differences to the fact that the fabricated thin film has a different gap voltage resistivity and thickness to what we expected. With a new set of estimated parameters we successfully reproduce the measured transmission profile. We further show that by utilising bridges to ensure equipotential grounds for the CPW lines we are able to reduce the rippling effect and achieve a higher gain with broader bandwidth. We expect that our TWPA can achieve higher than 20 dB gain from approximately 0-8 GHz.  ¬© COPYRIGHT SPIE. Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only.;
Bugs4Q: A Benchmark of Real Bugs for Quantum Programs;Realistic benchmarks of reproducible bugs and fixes are vital to good experimental evaluation of debugging and testing approaches. However there is no suitable benchmark suite that can systematically evaluate the debugging and testing methods of quantum programs until now. This paper proposes Bugs4Q a benchmark of thirty-six real manually validated Qiskit bugs from four popular Qiskit elements (Terra Aer Ignis and Aqua) supplemented with the test cases for reproducing buggy behaviors. Bugs4Q also provides interfaces for accessing the buggy and fixed versions of the Qiskit programs and executing the corresponding test cases facilitating the reproducible empirical studies and comparisons of Qiskit program debugging and testing tools.

Quantum circuits - An application in qiskit-python;For many practical applications Quantum computers offer major speed-ups over traditional machines. The production of quantum chips has recently made tremendous strides with the quantity of Qubits increasing and fidelity increasing. The smallest unit of information is the binary digit i.e. bit in general computing. In Quantum Computing the term Qubit (Quantum Bit) is used for the same purpose. In order to differentiate between a classical bit and a Qubit Bra-Ket or Dirac notation is used. So the Qubits are represented as |0 and 1| and are often read as Ket 0 for zero state and Ket 1 for one state.In this paper mainly programming and application sides of Quantum Computing are focused. For that Qiskit module and its tools are used in Python programming language. General circuit optimization scheme is given. The Quantum circuits with the concept of Quantum Gates implemented are stronger compared to the optimizing algorithm and with faster execution time. In addition for prime factorization access to IBM's Quantum computer is carried out successfully. ¬© 2021 IEEE.;
Heterogenous Integration of Silicon Ion Trap and Glass Interposer for Scalable Quantum Computing Enabled by TSV Micro-bumps and RDL;In this work we report the heterogenous integration of ion trap on silicon assembled on glass interposer where TSV micro-bumps and redistribution layer are implemented and allow for ion trap design with significantly high flexibility. CMOS-compatible back-end-of-line process is employed on 300 mm silicon/glass wafer platform. Due to the incorporation of TSVs into ion trap design the footprint of ion trap is reduced. Correspondingly low parasitic capacitance (3 pF) and RF loss (insertion loss of -0.1 dB at frequency of 50 MHz) are achieved presenting significant improvement than conventional trap that uses wire bonding as interconnections. The trap with reduced footprint also enables small-beam laser addressing. The obtained ion lifetime and heating rate are comparable with traps of similar dimension that operated in room temperature. Two solutions to mitigate trap heating issue are proposed. This heterogenous integrated ion trap is an important building block for scalable quantum information processing based on ion trap device. ¬© 2021 IEEE;
Advances in Silicon Quantum Photonics;Quantum technology is poised to enable a step change in human capability for computing communications and sensing. Photons are indispensable as carriers of quantum information-they travel at the fastest possible speed and readily protected from decoherence. However the system requires thousands of near-transparent components with ultra-low-latency control. To be implemented a new paradigm photonic system is required: one with in-built coherence stability the ability to define arbitrary circuits and a path to manufacturability. Silicon photonics has unparalleled density and component performance which with CMOS compatible fabrication place it in a strong position for a scalable quantum photonics platform. This paper is a progress report on silicon quantum photonics focused on developments in the past five years. We provide an introduction on silicon quantum photonic component and the challenges in the field summarise the current state-of-the-art and identify outstanding technical challenges as well as promising avenues of future research. We also resolve a conflict in the definition of Hong-Ou-Mandel interference visibility in integrated quantum photonic experiments needed for fair comparison of photon quality across different platforms. Our aim is the development of scalability on the platform to which end we point the way to ever-closer integration toward silicon quantum photonic systems-on-a-chip. ¬© 2020 IEEE.;
Quantum Petri Nets;The development of quantum software applications requires models capable to describe quantum features (superposition entanglement reversibility etc.) as well as the software algorithm requirements. The newly proposed Quantum Petri Nets (QPNs) have the structure of the classical Petri Nets (PNs) but their tokens represent superposed quantum states fulfilling the Hilbert space features. Instead of the integer numerical values of the PN marking QPNs use quantum marking describing an extreme huge space. New conditions for the transition enabling and new mappings for the transition executions are conceived. A PN based language is used for the structure analysis. Replacing the classical tokens with the probability distribution of the quantum vectors the QPN simulation is possible as well as the construction of a reachability graph. ¬© 2021 IEEE.;
Recent Advances and Future Perspectives of Single-Photon Avalanche Diodes for Quantum Photonics Applications;Photonic quantum technologies promise a revolution of the world of information processing from simulation and computing to communication and sensing thanks to the many advantages of exploiting single photons as quantum information carriers. In this scenario single-photon detectors play a key role. On the one hand superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) are able to provide remarkable performance on a broad spectral range but their applicability is often limited by the need of cryogenic operating temperatures. On the other hand single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) overcome the intrinsic limitations of SNSPDs by providing a valid alternative at room temperature or slightly below. In this paper the authors review the fundamental principles of the SPAD operation and provide a thorough discussion of the recent progress made in this field comparing the performance of these devices with the requirements of the quantum photonics applications. In the end the authors conclude with their vision of the future by summarizing prospects and unbeaten paths that can open new perspectives in the field of photonic quantum information¬†processing. ¬© 2020 The Authors.

QuNetSim: A Software Framework for Quantum Networks;As quantum network technologies develop the need for teaching and engineering tools such as simulators and emulators rises. QuNetSim addresses this need. QuNetSim is a Python software framework that delivers an easy-to-use interface for simulating quantum networks at the network layer which can be extended at little effort of the user to implement the corresponding link layer protocols. The goal of QuNetSim is to make it easier to investigate and test quantum networking protocols over various quantum network configurations and parameters. The framework incorporates many known quantum network protocols so that users can quickly build simulations using a quantum-networking toolbox in a few lines of code and so that beginners can easily learn to implement their own quantum networking protocols. Unlike most current tools QuNetSim simulates with real time and is therefore well suited to control laboratory hardware. Here we present a software design overview of QuNetSim and demonstrate examples of protocols implemented with it. We describe ongoing work which uses QuNetSim as a library and describe possible future directions for the development of QuNetSim. ¬© 2021 IEEE.;
Asynchronous effects;We explore asynchronous programming with algebraic effects. We complement their conventional synchronous treatment by showing how to naturally also accommodate asynchrony within them namely by decoupling the execution of operation calls into signalling that an operation's implementation needs to be executed and interrupting a running computation with the operation's result to which the computation can react by installing interrupt handlers. We formalise these ideas in a small core calculus called Œª√¶. We demonstrate the flexibility of Œª√¶ using examples ranging from a multi-party web application to preemptive multi-threading to remote function calls to a parallel variant of runners of algebraic effects. In addition the paper is accompanied by a formalisation of Œª√¶'s type safety proofs in Agda and a prototype implementation of Œª√¶ in OCaml.  ¬© 2021 Owner/Author.;
PhotoniQLAB: A framework for simulating photonic quantum information processing experiments;Simulators for photonic quantum information processing (PQIP) experiments are essentially different with currently available quantum-circuit simulators. In PQIP experiments photons are usually encoded by multiple degrees of freedom some of which are multi-level or even infinite-level. Moreover the evolution of indistinguishable photons cannot be described elegantly by the model used in quantum-circuit simulators. A simulator focusing on PQIP experiments is urgently needed as it plays an important role in PQIP experiments designing and verification. We developed PhotoniQLAB an object-oriented framework designed for simulating PQIP experiments which provides a virtual-lab user experience. The core simulation unit is a computer algebraic system based on the second quantization method. PhotoniQLAB only requires users to enter the structure information of a target PQIP experiment to conduct a simulation as it can understand the topological structure by itself. The mathematical foundation and technical details of PhotoniQLAB are discussed in the paper. The performance of PhotoniQLAB which is analyzed and used to simulate several experimental schemes in this paper has been shown to be efficient enough for near-term PQIP experiments. PhotoniQLAB shows its flexibility and universality through simulating more than 60 existing PQIP experiments in published papers. We believe that PhotoniQLAB will become a fundamental PQIP software infrastructure facilitating the analyses and designs of PQIP experiments. ¬© 2021 The Author(s).;
Sagnac-type entangled photon source using only conventional polarization optics;We designed and implemented a novel combination of a Sagnac-interferometer with a Mach‚ÄìZehnder interferometer for a source of polarization-entangled photons. The new versatile configuration does not require multi-wavelength polarization optics yet it performs with a good polarization quality and phase-stability over a wide wavelength range. We demonstrate the interferometer using only standard commercial optics to experimentally realize the pulsed generation of polarization-entangled photon-pairs at wavelengths of 764 nm and 1221 nm via type-I spontaneous four-wave mixing in a polarization-maintaining fiber. Polarization entanglement was verified by a polarization-correlation measurement with a visibility of 95.5% from raw coincidence counts and the violation of the Clauser‚ÄìHorne‚ÄìShimony‚ÄìHolt (CHSH) inequality with S = 2.70 ¬± 0.04. The long-term phase-stability was characterized by an Allan deviation of 8‚ó¶ over an integration time of about 1 h with no active phase-stabilization. ¬© 2021 IOP Publishing Ltd.;
Quantum features of structured light;The development of structured light affords new opportunities to exploit the spatial degrees of freedom for beams with wave-vector components transverse to the direction of propagation. This introduces an additional dimension to the information-conveying capacity of individual photons. However several quantum issues of optical vortex interactions with detectors demand scrutiny. For any essentially paraxial vortex beam while the spin and orbital parts of photon angular momentum are well defined the corresponding quantum operators do not satisfy the proper commutation structure for non-paraxial fields they are not even separable. In the local measurement of any such property of individual photons it is also important to recognize that absolute measurement is fundamentally compromised by the preclusion of a position operator as is true for any relativistic quantum particle. Quantum uncertainty itself obviates the precise positional registration of any particular orbital angular momentum through any angle-specific aperture. Optical modes with marginally different directions of propagation cannot be discriminated with arbitrary precision: conservation of the summed orbital angular momentum comprising a sum of optical and material elements can only be ascertained in terms of expectation values. The orthogonality of optical states of a given beam wavelength and direction but with different orbital angular momentum values certainly affords extensive opportunities for quantum communication: the enhanced encoding of information per photon in a high-dimensionality transverse structure is however subject to both fundamental quantum and technical constraints. ¬© 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Translation Techniques for Reversible Circuit Synthesis with Positive and Negative Controls;This chapter presents translation techniques that can be applied to a reversible Boolean function to enhance the synthesis of a reversible circuit with positive and negative controls realizing that function. A mapping inverting selected input-output pairs and a second mapping involving the permutation of input-output pairs are introduced. Peres gates are generalized to have negative as well as positive controls and techniques for simplifying reversible circuits with positive and negative controls are examined. Experimental results for all 3-variable reversible functions and for selected worst case functions are presented and evaluated with regard to quantum circuit realization using the NCV quantum gate library. The experiments are conducted using various forms of transformation-based synthesis including a novel search-based approach. The results show the methods presented have promise and should likely be considered for use with more sophisticated reversible circuit synthesis methods. ¬© The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.;
A computational interpretation of compact closed categories: Reversible programming with negative and fractional types;"Compact closed categories include objects representing higher-order functions and are well-established as models of linear logic concurrency and quantum computing. We show that it is possible to construct such compact closed categories for conventional sum and product types by defining a dual to sum types a negative type and a dual to product types a fractional type. Inspired by the categorical semantics we define a sound operational semantics for negative and fractional types in which a negative type represents a computational effect that reverses execution flow""and a fractional type represents a computational effect that ""garbage collects""particular values or throws exceptions. Specifically we extend a first-order reversible language of type isomorphisms with negative and fractional types specify an operational semantics for each extension and prove that each extension forms a compact closed category. We furthermore show that both operational semantics can be merged using the standard combination of backtracking and exceptions resulting in a smooth interoperability of negative and fractional types. We illustrate the expressiveness of this combination by writing a reversible SAT solver that uses backtracking search along freshly allocated and de-allocated locations. The operational semantics most of its meta-theoretic properties and all examples are formalized in a supplementary Agda package.  ¬© 2021 Owner/Author.""";
Quito: A Coverage-Guided Test Generator for Quantum Programs;Automation in quantum software testing is essential to support systematic and cost-effective testing. Towards this direction we present a quantum software testing tool called Quito that can automatically generate test suites covering three coverage criteria defined on inputs and outputs of a quantum program coded in Qiskit i.e. input coverage output coverage and input-output coverage. Quito also implements two types of test oracles based on program specifications i.e. checking whether a quantum program produced a wrong output or checking a probabilistic test oracle with statistical test. We describe the architecture and methodology of the tool. We also validated the tool with one quantum program and one faulty version of it. Results indicate that Quito can generate test suites and perform test assessments that detect faults and produce test results with a good time performance.Quito's code: https://github.com/Simula-COMPLEX/quitoQuito's video: https://youtu.be/kuI9QaCo8A8Artifact Available: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5288665  ¬© 2021 IEEE.;
Hybrid Quantum Applications Need Two Orchestrations in Superposition: A Software Architecture Perspective;Quantum applications are most often hybrid i.e. they are not only made of implementations of pure quantum algorithms but also of classical programs as well as workflows and topologies as key artifacts and data they process. Since workflows and topologies are referred to as 'orchestrations' in modern terminology (but with very different meanings) two orchestrations that go hand-in-hand are required to realize quantum applications. We motivate this by means of a nontrivial example sketch these orchestration technologies and reveal the overall structure of non-trivial quantum applications. Furthermore we discuss the implied architecture of a runtime environment for such quantum applications. To validate the introduced architecture we present a prototypical implementation based on the Camunda workflow engine its associated modeling tool as well as the OpenTOSCA ecosystem. ¬© 2021 IEEE.;
Exponentially Many Local Minima in Quantum Neural Networks;Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) or the so-called variational quantum circuits are important quantum applications both because of their similar promises as classical neural networks and because of the feasibility of their implementation on near-term intermediate-size noisy quantum machines (NISQ). However the training task of QNNs is challenging and much less understood. We conduct a quantitative investigation on the landscape of loss functions of QNNs and identify a class of simple yet extremely hard QNN instances for training. Specifically we show for typical under-parameterized QNNs there exists a dataset that induces a loss function with the number of spurious local minima depending exponentially on the number of parameters. Moreover we show the optimality of our construction by providing an almost matching upper bound on such dependence. While local minima in classical neural networks are due to non-linear activations in quantum neural networks local minima appear as a result of the quantum interference phenomenon. Finally we empirically confirm that our constructions can indeed be hard instances in practice with typical gradient-based optimizers which demonstrates the practical value of our findings.

Reliability Characterization of a Flexible Interconnect for Cryogenic and Quantum Applications;We present reliability characterization of a polyimide/copper-based flexible interconnect designed for cryogenic and quantum computing applications. This interconnect design uses commercial fabrication processes and off-the-shelf parts. Experiments were performed on production flexible interconnect parts. Samples underwent a series of tests including rapid thermal cycling by liquid helium submersion cold bias stress room temperature fatigue bending connect-disconnect of the interconnect connector and in-plane shear stress. The results found that the samples are remarkably robust. All tested flexible interconnect tapes showed no failures in the entire study post reliability stress. Failures were observed on the connector solution chosen for this engineering design. This paper will present the experimental data and results from the flexible interconnects bonded to a commercial off-the-shelf connector part. A model is described to estimate a system failure rate due to the flexible interconnect and connector subassembly failures. The results of this study conclude that the flexible interconnect tapes are well suited for cryogenic temperature applications.  ¬© 2021 IEEE.;
Effect of closely-spaced excited states on electromagnetically induced transparency;Electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) is a well-known phenomenon due in part to its applicability to quantum devices such as quantum memories and quantum gates. EIT is commonly modeled with a three-level lambda system however this simplified model does not capture all the physics of EIT experiments with real systems. We present a theoretical study of the effect of two closely-spaced excited states on EIT and off-resonance Raman transitions. In addition to the expected broadening of the EIT resonance and reduction in EIT transparency due to multiple excited states we find some unexpected and interesting results. A comparison with a model that does not allow for coupling of the excited states shows that the coherent interaction of the fields with two excited states whose separation is smaller than their Doppler broadened linewidth can enhance the EIT transparency under some conditions and can enhance and shift the resonance frequency of off-resonance Raman absorption. Furthermore through a dressed state analysis of the full four-level system we find that the underlying mechanism for the reduction in EIT transparency is a shift in the two-photon resonance due to unequal dipole moments of the transitions coupled by the control field. Complete transparency can only be recovered for systems with equal dipole moments or when the separation between the two excited states is at least of the order of the Doppler width. To support our theoretical study we present experimental EIT measurements in the D1 lines of 85Rb and 87Rb that agree with our predictions of an enhancement or reduction of EIT transparency under specific conditions. The experimental results also verify the roles that the dipole moments and the separation between the two excited states have on recovering the EIT transparency.  ¬© 2021 Optical Society of America.;
Quantum Computing Platforms: Assessing the Impact on Quality Attributes and SDLC Activities;Practical quantum computing is rapidly becoming a reality. To harness quantum computers' real potential in software applications one needs to have an in-depth understanding of all such characteristics of quantum computing platforms (QCPs) relevant from the Software Engineering (SE) perspective. Restrictions on copying deletion the transmission of qubit states a hard dependency on quantum algorithms are few out of many examples of QCP characteristics that have significant implications for building quantum software. Thus developing quantum software requires a paradigm shift in thinking by software engineers. This paper presents the key findings from the SE perspective resulting from an in-depth examination of state-of-the-art QCPs available today. The main contributions that we present include i) Proposing a general architecture of the QCPs ii) Proposing a programming model for developing quantum software iii) Determining architecturally significant characteristics of QCPs and iv) Determining the impact of these characteristics on various Quality Attributes (QAs) and Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) activities. We show that the nature of QCPs makes them useful mainly in specialized application areas such as scientific computing. Except for performance and scalability most of the other QAs (e.g. maintainability testability and reliability) are adversely affected by different characteristics of a QCP. ¬© 2021 IEEE.;

Quantum Computing Technology;Quantum Computing has inspired scientists as well as hardware and software developers and is fundamentally changing the landscape of information technology. Quantum computing systems are built from the bottom up reaching the limits of what can be classically simulated. The IBM Quantum Development Roadmap describes our vision of creating a quantum computing ecosystem delivering quantum applications through the cloud. This requires developing the entire quantum computing stack starting from the qubit and quantum processor technology control electronics to software algorithms and applications for quantum computing implemented in the cloud and integrated with high performance computing. Though today's noisy near-Term quantum computing systems are still limited the roadmap targets to achieve an inflection point benefiting of continuous improvements across the stack driving quantum performance described by more qubits higher quantum volume and speed.  ¬© 2021 IEEE.;
Distinguishability of generalized Bell states in arbitrary dimension system via one-way local operations and classical communication;We investigate the distinguishability of generalized Bell states (GBSs) in arbitrary dimension system by one-way local operations and classical communication (LOCC). Firstly by analyzing three local unitary transformations we define two concepts for each set L of GBSs i.e. an admissible solutions set SA and a genuinely nonadmissible solutions set SL. Then we show that a set L of any GBSs can be distinguished by one-way LOCC if SA\ SL is nonempty. Fan‚Äôs and Wang et al.‚Äôs results (Phys Rev Lett 92:177905 2004: Phys Rev A 99:022307 2019) can be covered by our result. Comparing with Wang et al.‚Äôs result our successful ratio of local distinguishability improves markedly especially for even dimension system. In some cases it can increase by nearly 42 %. However there are still some cases where our method cannot work. For the uncovered cases we define an uncovered set and present that there is no method which is more powerful than ours for local discrimination of GBSs if the uncovered set is a subset of the different set of GBSs. ¬© 2021 The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media LLC part of Springer Nature.;
Quantum biotech and internet of virus things: Towards a theoretical framework;Quantumization the process of converting information into quantum (qubit) format is a key enabler for propelling a new and distinct infrastructure in the pharmaceutical space. Quantum messenger RNA (QmRNA) technology an indispensable constituent of quantum biotech (QB) is a compelling alternative to conventional vaccine methods because of its capacity for rapid development high efficacy and low-cost manufacturing to combat infectious diseases. Internet of Virus Things (IoVT) a biological version of Internet of Things (IoT) comprises applications to fight against pandemics and provides effective vaccine administration. The integration of QB and IoVT constitutes the QBIoVT system to advance the prospect of QmRNA vaccine discovery within a few days. This research disseminates the QBIoVT system paradigm including architectural aspects priority areas challenges applications and QmRNA research engine design to accelerate QmRNA vaccines discovery. A comprehensive review of the literature was accomplished and a context-centered methodology was applied to the QBIoVT paradigm forensic investigations to impel QmRNA vaccine discovery. Based on the above rumination the principal motive for this study was to develop a novel QBIoVT theoretical framework which has not been produced through earlier theories. The proposed framework shall inspire future QBIoVT system research activities to improve pandemics detection and protection. ¬© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI Basel Switzerland.;
Non-Magnetic Non-Reciprocal Microwave Components‚ÄîState of the Art and Future Directions;Non-reciprocal components such as circulators isolators and gyrators find utility in numerous microwave wireless applications including high-power transmitters simultaneous transmit-and-receive communication and radar systems and emerging cryogenic quantum computing implementations. Today such components are implemented using ferrite materials which lose their reciprocity under the application of an external magnetic field. However ferrite materials are incompatible with semiconductor integrated-circuit fabrication processes and therefore ferrite non-reciprocal components are difficult to miniaturize to chip scales rendering them bulky and expensive. This has motivated significant research into non-magnetic non-reciprocal components over the past 50 years. In recent years this research has been invigorated by breakthroughs in time-modulated non-reciprocal components and their integration into silicon integrated circuits. This paper reviews the history of non-reciprocal electronics surveys recent research results in the area and describes outstanding directions for future research. ¬© IEEE Journal of Microwaves.

Continuous Variable Quantum Compilation;In recent years quantum computing has evolved from a research concept subject to reality. Companies and scientists around the world are creating physical quantum systems using different quantum technologies to advance the field. Although most of this focus is on superconducting qubit-based implementations recently there has been work in the development of boson-based quantum computers. The basic processing unit for these devices are continuous variable (CV) multi-photonic modes in Gaussian states. Due to the novel nature of this technology there is a lack of work on analyzing the compilation process of current photonic devices. One of the leading companies in this field developed a cross-platform Python library for simulating and executing programs on quantum photonic hardware Strawberry Fields (SF). This paper will focus on analyzing the SF compilers and proposing an additional compilation step that will enable future more flexible hardware implementations. ¬© 2021 IEEE.;
On Structured Design Space Exploration for Mapping of Quantum Algorithms;Quantum algorithms can be expressed as quantum circuits when the circuit model of computation is adopted. Such a circuit description is usually hardware-agnostic that is it does not consider the limitations that the quantum hardware might have. In order to make quantum algorithms executable on quantum devices they need to comply to their constraints which mainly affect the parallelism of quantum operations and the possible interactions between the qubits. The process of adapting a quantum circuit to meet the quantum chip restrictions is known as mapping. The resulting circuit usually has a higher number of gates and depth decreasing the algorithm's reliability. Different mapping solutions have been already proposed. Most of them are meant for a specific quantum processor and differ in methodology approach and features. In addition they are usually only compared in terms of added gates circuit depth and compilation time. No thorough comparative analysis of the different mapping solutions performance and features has been performed so far.In this paper we propose to apply structured design space exploration (DSE) methodologies to the mapping procedures. This will allow not only to have a more in depth and structured analysis of their performance but also to identify what features are key and worth to implement. By using DSE we will be able to: i) determine in what regimes some mapping solutions outperform others ii) derive optimal mapping strategies for specific quantum algorithms and quantum processors and iii) perform an scalability analysis. In addition DSE techniques cannot only be applied to the mapping layer that is key for bridging quantum applications to quantum devices but also to the full-stack quantum computing system allowing for its crosslayer co-design. ¬© 2020 IEEE.;
Quantum logic programming with Weyl predicates;In our previous work we described quantized computation using Horn clauses and based the semantics dubbed as entanglement semantics as a generalization of denotational and distribution semantics and founded it on quantum probability by exploiting the key insight classical random variables have quantum decompositions. Towards this end we built a Hilbert space of H-interpretations and a corresponding non commutative von Neumann algebra of bounded linear operators. In this work we extend the formalism using second-quantized Horn clauses that describe processes such as Heisenberg evolutions in optical circuits quantum walks and quantum filters in a formally verifiable way. Our goal is to build a model of computation based on logic via Currry-Howard correspondence. Towards this end we can think of completely positive ‚àó-unital maps of Horn clauses as function types representing modus ponens (equation (19)). Recursions that result from inductive reasoning has a quantum analogue in terms of sequence of ‚àó-homomorphisms induced by completely positive ‚àó-unital maps (equation (18)). We base our system on a measure theoretic approach to handle infinite dimensional systems and demonstrate the expressive power of the formalism by casting an algebra used to describe interconnected quantum systems (QNET) in this language. The variables of a Horn clause bounded by universal or existential quantifiers can be used to describe parameters of optical components such as beam splitter scattering paths cavity detuning from resonance strength of a laser beam or input and output ports of these components. Prominent clauses in this non commutative framework are Weyl predicates that are operators on a Boson Fock space in the language of quantum stochastic calculus martingales and conjugate Brownian motions compactly representing statistics of quantum field fluctuations. We formulate theorem proving as a quantum stochastic process in Heisenberg picture of quantum mechanics a sequence of goals to be proved using backward chaining.  ¬© COPYRIGHT SPIE.

Energy Efficiency Analysis of Post-Quantum Cryptographic Algorithms;Classical cryptographic schemes in use today are based on the difficulty of certain number theoretic problems. Security is guaranteed by the fact that the computational work required to break the core mechanisms of these schemes on a conventional computer is infeasible however the difficulty of these problems would not withstand the computational power of a large-scale quantum computer. To this end the post-quantum cryptography (PQC) standardization process initiated by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is well underway. In addition to the evaluation criteria provided by NIST the energy consumption of these candidate algorithms is also an important criterion to consider due to the use of battery-operated devices high-performance computing environments where energy costs are critical as well as in the interest of green computing. In this paper the energy consumption of PQC candidates is evaluated on an Intel Core i7-6700 CPU using PAPI the Performance API. The energy measurements are categorized based on their proposed security level and cryptographic functionality. The results are then further subdivided based on the underlying mechanism used in order to identify the most energy-efficient schemes. Lastly IgProf is used to identify the most energy-consuming subroutines within a select number of submissions to highlight potential areas for optimization.  ¬© 2013 IEEE.;
Non-classical light source with single photon and squeezing properties in a nanoscale photonic-crystal-plasmonic system;Single photon and squeezing properties are important in on[1]chip quantum applications.

Nb-Based Superconducting Silicon Interconnect Fabric for Cryogenic Computing Applications;As the number of qubits goes beyond one million the I/O count and the interconnect wiring within a limited area become problematic. In this paper we present a simple integration method (an Au interiayer) with a fine interconnect pitch (10 urn) and close lateral die spacing (60 urn) that can overcome the large I/O and high wiring level requirements of very large scale of quantum circuits. A System-on Wafer (SoW) Superconducting Silicon Interconnect Fabric (Superconducting-ID is proposed with the help of the mentioned Au interiayer technology. Through three testing structures the Au interiayer integration technology is demonstrated to be fine pitch (<10 urn) Josephson-Junction-compatible (<150¬∞C) mechanically robust (> 30 MPa) on various bonding areas and electrically reliable at 2 K. It is one of the first demonstrations of the robust and reliable Au interiayer optimized for quantum applications. This work enables quantum computing to uncover its full strength through high-density (>10000 mm2 I/O and dense wiring) heterogeneous integration. ¬© 2021 IEEE;

Models in quantum computing: a systematic review;Quantum computing is computing beyond classical computing based on quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement. While quantum computing is still seeking its shape its effect is seen in making magnificent strides in the field of computing bringing into bare a new dimension of computing. Nevertheless just like any other concept or field it has some challenges and a lot of research and work need to be done to realize its capabilities and benefits. This review provides an insight into quantum computing models coupled with the identification of some pros and cons. The main contribution of this systematic review is that it summarizes the current state-of-the-art models of quantum computing in various domains. It provides new classifications of quantum models based on the literature reviewed and links results to that of the four major categories of quantum computing models. Assessment reveals that most of the models reviewed are either mathematical or algorithmic even though they are based on quantum operations and circuits. ¬© 2021 The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media LLC part of Springer Nature.;
Circular Optical Arrays Using Waveguide Fed 45¬∞ Angled Mirrors;An array of optical waveguide fed 45¬∞ metal-coated mirrors are proposed and validated by simulation for generating optical scalar and vector vortices. Subwavelength element-to-element spacings are achieved which is not possible in traditional grating-based phased arrays. This vortex source can be superior over other methods like phase masks which are not planar process integrable with lasers and phase modulators. A simple plane wave reflection model is used to analyze the mirror and the results are matched with reasonable tolerance against simulation results. The spin and orbital angular momentum charges are directly calculated from the field values for quantifying the performance. Four- and eight-element arrays are studied. The matching of prediction with simulation has been good for linear azimuthal and radial polarization. Good angular momentum conversion efficiencies are obtained for up to orbital angular momentum charges {l;
An introduction to generalized entropy and some quantum applications;The concept of generalized entropy is introduced and some of its prop¬¨erties are studied. Irreversible time evolution can be generated by a non-Hermitian superoperator on the states of the system. The case when irre¬¨versibility comes about from embedding the system in a thermal reservoir is considered. The time evolution is found to be compatible both with equilibrium thermodynamics and entropy production near the final state. Some examples are presented. An introduction to how this work may play a role in resolving the black hole information loss paradox is given. ¬© 2021 Nova Science Publishers Inc.;
A verified optimizer for Quantum circuits;We present VOQC the first fully verified optimizer for quantum circuits written using the Coq proof assistant. Quantum circuits are expressed as programs in a simple low-level language called SQIR a simple quantum intermediate representation which is deeply embedded in Coq. Optimizations and other transformations are expressed as Coq functions which are proved correct with respect to a semantics of SQIR programs. SQIR uses a semantics of matrices of complex numbers which is the standard for quantum computation but treats matrices symbolically in order to reason about programs that use an arbitrary number of quantum bits. SQIR's careful design and our provided automation make it possible to write and verify a broad range of optimizations in VOQC including full-circuit transformations from cutting-edge optimizers.  ¬© 2021 Owner/Author.;
Assessing the Effectiveness of Input and Output Coverage Criteria for Testing Quantum Programs;Quantum programs implement quantum algorithms solving complex computational problems. Testing such programs is challenging due to the inherent characteristics of Quantum Computing (QC) such as the probabilistic nature and computations in superposition. However automated and systematic testing is needed to ensure the correct behavior of quantum programs. To this end we present an approach called Quito (QUantum InpuT Output coverage) consisting of three coverage criteria defined on the inputs and outputs of a quantum program together with their test generation strategies. Moreover we define two types of test oracles together with a procedure to determine the passing and failing of test suites with statistical analyses. To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the three coverage criteria we conducted experiments with five quantum programs. We used mutation analysis to determine the coverage criteria' effectiveness and cost in terms of the number of test cases. Based on the results of mutation analysis we also identified equivalent mutants for quantum programs. ¬© 2021 IEEE.;
Quantum Computing: An Entanglement Measurement;Quantum Computing technologies with rapid proliferation have achieved important milestones in recent years. Quantum concept of entanglement has emerged rapidly with its application domains widely expanding.

TEQUILA: A platform for rapid development of quantum algorithms;Variational quantum algorithms are currently the most promising class of algorithms for deployment on near-term quantum computers. In contrast to classical algorithms there are almost no standardized methods in quantum algorithmic development yet and the field continues to evolve rapidly. As in classical computing heuristics play a crucial role in the development of new quantum algorithms resulting in a high demand for flexible and reliable ways to implement test and share new ideas. Inspired by this demand we introduce tequila a development package for quantum algorithms in python designed for fast and flexible implementation prototyping and deployment of novel quantum algorithms in electronic structure and other fields. tequila operates with abstract expectation values which can be combined transformed differentiated and optimized. On evaluation the abstract data structures are compiled to run on state of the art quantum simulators or interfaces.  ¬© 2021 IOP Publishing Ltd.;
Design and modeling of a photonic integrated device for optical vortex generation in a silicon waveguide;We propose and numerically verify a design of the photonic integrated circuit for in-plane generation of a 1st azimuthal order vortex mode in dielectric rectangular waveguides.

Applying a mode coupling and specific phase shift a field with the required amplitude-phase distribution is formed directly in the output waveguide. The geometric dimensions of the device are simulated and optimized to fit the technological parameters of the silicon-on-insulator platform. ¬© 2021 Institution of Russian Academy of Sciences.

Cryo-CMOS Electronics for Quantum Computing: Bringing Classical Electronics Closer to Qubits in Space and Temperature;The core of a quantum computer is a quantum processor which is composed of quantum bits (qubits). Qubits can be implemented in many flavors but they are fragile and their state has a tendency to decay in time. To be usable for computation qubits must be corrected in real time by a classical controller. The controller must also see that desired computations are executed. Today the control of qubits is performed at room temperature (RT) by racks of instruments while the qubits operate at several tens of milli-Kelvin. To ensure compactness and eventually scalability we have proposed and implemented CMOS circuits designed to operate at a few degrees Kelvin. This makes complex thermalization circuits unnecessary potentially enabling superconductive interconnects which would enable virtually zero resistance and low thermal conductivity. Cryogenic CMOS or cryo-CMOS technology was chosen to achieve classical control due to its scalable nature and overall miniaturization opportunities. Cryo-CMOS circuits and systems need to be carefully designed to ensure strict power budgets while achieving quite advanced specifications in terms of noise and bandwidth. We review the requirements of a classical controller and cryo-CMOS circuits and systems developed for spin qubits in our lab. Results and perspectives are presented with a discussion about a road map for the future.  ¬© 2009-2012 IEEE.;
An accurate circuit model for the statistical behavior of inp/ingaas spad;In the field of near-infrared weak light detection an InP/InGaAs single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) is preferred due to the advantages of high sensitivity low cost and room-temperature operation. To properly simulate and optimize the SPAD‚Äôs front-end circuit a comprehensive and compact behavior model of the InP/InGaAs SPAD is normally required to accurately describe the statistical behavior of the detectors. In this paper an InP/InGaAs SPAD analytical model is constructed which not only includes the direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC) behavior simulating the avalanche and quenching processes but also describes the dark count after-pulsing and photon detection efficiency. For dark count noise three important generation mechanisms are considered including thermal generation trap-assisted tunneling and band-to-band tunneling. The model described by the Verilog-A hardware description language (HDL) can be directly implemented in the commercial circuit simulator. A gated mode passive quenching and recharging circuit is used to simulate and verify the developed model. The simulation results are in good agreement with the reported test data demonstrating the accuracy of the developed InP/InGaAs SPAD model. ¬© 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI Basel Switzerland.;
A 4.2mW 4K 6-8GHz CMOS LNA for Superconducting Qubit Readout;Millions of qubits need to be employed in a quantum computer to achieve a fault-tolerant quantum operation. To reduce the complexity in such a large-scale system the control and readout circuitries have been proposed to be placed at the 4 K stage of dilution refrigerators [1]. CMOS technology is commonly used to leverage its scaling to enable large integration of control and readout circuitries with qubits. However the high-fidelity readout operations require low noise amplifiers (LNAs) with a noise temperature of a few Kelvins. This necessitates the usage of HEMT and parametric amplifiers [2]. Recently reported CMOS LNAs are still far away from attaining such good performance [3-5]. Thus this is one of the greatest challenges on the way to the fully integrated CMOS readout. Additionally due to the limited cooling power of dilution refrigerators low-power solutions are needed for achieving a very good noise performance at 4 K. This paper presents a 28 nm CMOS LNA for qubit readout which achieves an order of magnitude power reduction compared to its CMOS counterparts while still providing a similar good noise Figure (NF) performance at 4 K.  ¬© 2021 IEEE.;

The study shows that quantum circuits can be generated automatically to further improve the efficiency of quantum algorithms. ¬© 2021 IEEE.;
Protocols for Packet Quantum Network Intercommunication;A quantum network which involves multiple parties pinging each other with quantum messages could revolutionize communication computing and basic sciences. The future internet will be a global system of various packet switching quantum and classical networks and we call it quantum internet. To build a quantum Internet unified protocols that support the distribution of quantum messages within it are necessary. Intuitively one would extend classical internet protocols to handle quantum messages. However classical network mechanisms especially those related to error control and reliable connection implicitly assume that information can be duplicated which is not true in the quantum world due to the no-cloning theorem and monogamy of entanglement. In this article we investigate and propose protocols for packet quantum network intercommunication. To handle the packet loss problem in transport we propose a quantum retransmission protocol based on the recursive use of a quantum secret sharing scheme. Other Internet protocols are also discussed. In particular the creation of logical process-to-process connections is accomplished by a quantum version of the three-way handshake protocol. ¬© 2021 by the Author(s).;
Chip-scale nonlinear photonics for quantum light generation;Nonclassical states of light are an essential resource for many emerging quantum technologies and applications ranging from information processing encrypted communications and networking to sensing metrology and imaging. Nonlinear optical processes in solid-state materials are widely used for generating quantum light including single photons entangled-photon pairs and quadrature-squeezed states. Recent advances in nonlinear photonics have enabled the functionality of benchtop nonlinear instruments to be scaled down to a single chip without sacrificing efficiency or degrading the key performance metrics. The dramatic improvement in the size weight power cost and stability enabled by photonic integrated circuits has been essential for enabling the chip-scale generation manipulation and detection of quantum light at a steadily increasing degree of complexity and scale. Within the last decade the authors have seen the progression from few-component photonic circuits operating on two photons to arrays of 18 identical heralded single-photon sources and reconfigurable devices operating with more than 650 components for multidimensional entanglement and arbitrary two-photon quantum gates. In this review the authors summarize the history and recent key technological developments of chip-scale nonlinear quantum light generation based on integrated nonlinear photonics recent advances in heterogeneous integrated methods and approaches for system-level integration and demonstrated applications. ¬© 2020 Author(s).;

Integrated Quantum Photonics with Silicon Carbide: Challenges and Prospects;Optically addressable solid-state spin defects are promising candidates for storing and manipulating quantum information using their long coherence ground-state manifold individual defects can be entangled using photon-photon interactions offering a path toward large-scale quantum photonic networks. Quantum computing protocols place strict limits on the acceptable photon losses in the system. These low-loss requirements cannot be achieved without photonic engineering but are attainable if combined with state-of-the-art nanophotonic technologies. However most materials that host spin defects are challenging to process: as a result the performance of quantum photonic devices is orders of magnitude behind that of their classical counterparts. Silicon carbide (SiC) is well suited to bridge the classical-quantum photonics gap since it hosts promising optically addressable spin defects and can be processed into SiC-on-insulator for scalable integrated photonics. In this paper we discuss recent progress toward the development of scalable quantum photonic technologies based on solid-state spins in silicon carbide and discuss current challenges and future directions. ¬© 2020 authors.

QUANTIFY: A framework for resource analysis and design verification of quantum circuits;Quantum resource analysis is crucial for designing quantum circuits as well as assessing the viability of arbitrary (error-corrected) quantum computations. To this end we introduce QUANTIFY which is an open-source framework for the quantitative analysis of quantum circuits. It is based on Google Cirq and is developed with Clifford+T circuits in mind and it includes the necessary methods to handle Toffoli+H and more generalised controlled quantum gates too. Key features of QUANTIFY include: (1) analysis and optimisation methods which are compatible with the surface code (2) choice between different automated (mixed polarity) Toffoli gate decompositions (3) semi-automatic quantum circuit rewriting and quantum gate insertion methods that take into account known gate commutation rules and (4) novel optimiser types that can be combined with different verification methods (e.g. truth table or circuit invariants like number of wires). For benchmarking purposes QUANTIFY includes quantum memory and quantum arithmetic circuits. Experimental results show that the framework's performance scales to circuits with thousands of qubits. ¬© 2020 IEEE.;
Orbital Angular Momentum Waves: Generation Detection and Emerging Applications;Orbital angular momentum (OAM) has aroused a widespread interest in many fields especially in telecommunications due to its potential for unleashing new capacity in the severely congested spectrum of commercial communication systems. Beams carrying OAM have a helical phase front and a field strength with a singularity along the axial center which can be used for information transmission imaging and particle manipulation. The number of orthogonal OAM modes in a single beam is theoretically infinite and each mode is an element of a complete orthogonal basis that can be employed for multiplexing different signals thus greatly improving the spectrum efficiency. In this paper we comprehensively summarize and compare the methods for generation and detection of optical OAM radio OAM and acoustic OAM. Then we represent the applications and technical challenges of OAM in communications including free-space optical communications optical fiber communications radio communications and acoustic communications. To complete our survey we also discuss the state of art of particle manipulation and target imaging with OAM beams. ¬© 1998-2012 IEEE.;
Density functional investigation of boron incorporation in silicon-vacancy complexes;The neutral silicon-vacancy complex in diamond is of interest for quantum applications due to its favourable optical properties relative to both its negative charge state and the nitrogen-vacancy centre. To establish an uncharged form co-doping with electrically active impurities has been suggested and although complexes with hydrogen or nitrogen have been identified complexes with boron are largely unstudied. This report presents results from density-functional modelling of SiB SiVB and SiVBH complexes some of which are expected to produce highly characteristic magnetic signatures. Critically for the neutral silicon-vacancy complex we find that boron binds less strongly than nitrogen or hydrogen. ¬© 2020 Elsevier B.V.;
Two-acoustic-cavity interaction mediated by superconducting artificial atoms;The circuit quantum acoustodynamics which are studied in hybrid quantum system composed by artificial atoms and surface acoustic waves (SAWs) have drawn a lot of attention when exploring the nonclassical properties of phonons. In this paper we propose a hybrid system for indirect coupling between multiple SAW resonators via auxiliary transmons. First by eliminating the qubit degrees of freedom the energy exchange between two SAW resonators can be observed. In the dispersive regime and suitable rotating frame Fock state transition and entanglement can be realized between two SAW resonators. Second by treating transmon as a qutrit and applying a classical driving for qutrit the correlated phonon pairs between two SAW resonators will be detected. Moreover by replacing the SAW resonators with acoustic-wave pumps the acoustically induced transparency phenomenon is realized in our system. The transmon qutrit is potential to use as a switch for propagating acoustic waves allowing the acoustic waves to be transmitted or backscattered. ¬© 2020 Springer Science+Business Media LLC part of Springer Nature.;
Quantum dilation and erosion;The dilation and erosion operations are the first fundamental step in classical image processing. They are important in many image processing algorithms to extract basic image features such as geometric shapes such shapes are then fed to higher level algorithms for object identification and recognition. In this paper we present an improved quantum method to realize dilation and erosion in imaging processing. Unlike in the classical way in the quantum version of imaging processing all of the information is stored in quantum bits (qubits). We use qubits to code the location and other information of each pixel of the images and apply quantum operators (or quantum gates) to accomplish specific functions. Because of quantum entanglement and other nonintuitive features in quantum mechanics qubits have many advantages over classical bits but their nature presents challenges in designing quantum algorithms. We first built the quantum circuit theoretically and then ran it on the IBM Quantum Experience platform to test and process real images. With this algorithm we are looking forward to more potential applications in quantum computation. ¬© 2020 by the authors.;
The bitter truth about gate-based quantum algorithms in the NISQ era;Implementing a gate-based quantum algorithm on an noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) device has several challenges that arise from the fact that such devices are noisy and have limited quantum resources. Thus various factors contributing to the depth and width as well as to the noise of an implementation of a gate-based algorithm must be understood in order to assess whether an implementation will execute successfully on a given NISQ device. In this contribution we discuss these factors and their impact on algorithm implementations. Especially we will cover state preparation oracle expansion connectivity circuit rewriting and readout: these factors are very often ignored when presenting a gate-based algorithm but they are crucial when implementing such an algorithm on near-term quantum computers. Our contribution will help developers in charge of realizing gate-based algorithms on such machines in (i) achieving an executable implementation and (ii) assessing the success of their implementation on a given machine. ¬© 2020 The Author(s).

Monolithic Plasmonic Waveguide Architecture for Passive and Active Optical Circuits;Guided-wave plasmonic circuits are promising platforms for sensing interconnection and quantum applications in the subdiffraction regime. Nonetheless the loss-confinement trade-off remains a collective bottleneck for plasmonic-enhanced optical processes.

Specifically record experimental attributes such as normalized Purcell factor approaching 104 10 dB amplitude modulation with <1 dB insertion loss and fJ-level switching energy and photodetection sensitivity and internal quantum efficiency of -54 dBm and 6.4% respectively have been realized within our amorphous-based coupled-mode plasmonic structure.

Enhancing a Near-Term Quantum Accelerator‚Äôs Instruction Set Architecture for Materials Science Applications;Quantum computers with tens to hundreds of noisy qubits are being developed today. To be useful for real-world applications we believe that these near-term systems cannot simply be scaled-down non-error-corrected versions of future fault-tolerant large-scale quantum computers. These near-term systems require specific architecture and design attributes to realize their full potential. To efficiently execute an algorithm the quantum coprocessor must be designed to scale with respect to qubit number and to maximize useful computation within the qubits‚Äô decoherence bounds. In this work we employ an application-system-qubit co-design methodology to architect a near-term quantum coprocessor. To support algorithms from the real-world application area of simulating the quantum dynamics of a material system we design a (parameterized) arbitrary single-qubit rotation instruction and a two-qubit entangling controlled-Z instruction. We introduce dynamic gate set and paging mechanisms to implement the instructions. To evaluate the functionality and performance of these two instructions we implement a two-qubit version of an algorithm to study a disorder-induced metal-insulator transition and run 60 random instances of it each of which realizes one disorder configuration and contains 40 two-qubit instructions (or gates) and 104 single-qubit instructions. We observe the expected quantum dynamics of the time-evolution of this system. ¬© 2021 IEEE.;
Silicon carbide color centers for quantum applications;Silicon carbide has recently surged as an alternative material for scalable and integrated quantum photonics as it is a host for naturally occurring color centers within its bandgap emitting from the UV to the IR even at telecom wavelength. Some of these color centers have been proved to be characterized by quantum properties associated with their single-photon emission and their coherent spin state control which make them ideal for quantum technology such as quantum communication computation quantum sensing metrology and can constitute the elements of future quantum networks. Due to its outstanding electrical mechanical and optical properties which extend to optical nonlinear properties silicon carbide can also supply a more amenable platform for photonics devices with respect to other wide bandgap semiconductors being already an unsurpassed material for high power microelectronics. In this review we will summarize the current findings on this material color centers quantum properties such as quantum emission via optical and electrical excitation optical spin polarization and coherent spin control and manipulation. Their fabrication methods are also summarized showing the need for on-demand and nanometric control of the color centers fabrication location in the material. Their current applications in single-photon sources quantum sensing of strain magnetic and electric fields spin-photon interface are also described. Finally the efforts in the integration of these color centers in photonics devices and their fabrication challenges are described. ¬© 2020 The Author(s). Published by IOP Publishing Ltd;
High-efficiency fiber-to-chip interface for aluminum nitride quantum photonics;Integrated nonlinear photonic circuits received rapid development in recent years providing all-optical functionalities enabled by cavity-enhanced photon-photon interaction for classical and quantum applications. A high-efficiency fiber-to-chip interface is key to these integrated photonic circuits for quantum information tasks as photon-loss is a major source that weakens quantum protocols. Here overcoming material and fabrication limitation of thin-film aluminum nitride by adopting a stepwise waveguiding scheme we demonstrate low-loss adiabatic fiber-optic couplers in aluminum nitride films with a substantial thickness (‚àº600 nm) for optimized nonlinear photon interaction. For telecom (1550 nm) and near-visible (780 nm) transverse magnetic-polarized light the measured insertion loss of the fiber-optic coupler is -0.97 dB and -2.6 dB respectively. Our results will facilitate the use of aluminum nitride integrated photonic circuits as efficient quantum resources for generation of entangled photons and squeezed light on microchips. ¬© 2020 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement.;
Monolithically integrated laser sources for applications beyond telecommunications;Photonic integration technologies allow for fabrication of on-chip laser sources and systems that provide functionalities for applications beyond telecommunications such as sensing healthcare millimeter and terahertz generation and quantum technologies. New applications impose a different range of demands regarding performance of such semiconductor laser sources. All characteristics of the optical output signal output power wavelength tuning range and mechanism long and short term stability as well as the energy footprint have to be considered. Monolithic integration technologies on indium phosphide substrates natively support an on-chip combination of active and passive functions that enable development of a new class semiconductor lasers with complex cavities. Such lasers can be tailored to achieve optimum performance with respect to a specific application. A number of single frequency tunable laser sources in form of photonic integrated circuits for applications in gas sensing optical coherence tomography millimeter and terahertz generation and quantum applications have been developed at Eindhoven University of Technology. Ongoing research and development activities that address challenges related to addressable wavelength bands wavelength tuning and stability imposed by specific applications are enabled by mature generic monolithic technology on indium phosphide. In parallel to those efforts extensive research works towards expansion of accessible wavelength bands.

How many trials do we need for reliable NISQ computing?;Gate-based quantum computing is an attractive candidate in the post-Moore era. Noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers are expected to be available in the next few years. It is required to repeatedly execute the target quantum application for reliable NISQ computing e.g. users can set 1024 as a repetition parameter in the IBM-Q machine because NISQ computers output follows the probability distribution of execution trials. Since the distribution depends strongly on the effects of noise it is difficult to determine a sufficient number of repetitions. This paper proposes a novel statistical approach for efficient NISQ computing. The key idea is to introduce a Bayesian credible interval model to obtain convergence of the probability distributions. We demonstrate that our execution method can detect all significant output values that occur more often than the random situation (probability is 1/2n) using a NISQ simulator. ¬© 2020 IEEE.;

Quantum transport in two-dimensional WS2 with high-efficiency carrier injection through indium alloy contacts;Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) have properties attractive for optoelectronic and quantum applications. A crucial element for devices is the metal-semiconductor interface. However high contact resistances have hindered progress. Quantum transport studies are scant as low-quality contacts are intractable at cryogenic temperatures. Here temperature-dependent transfer length measurements are performed on chemical vapor deposition grown single-layer and bilayer WS2 devices with indium alloy contacts. The devices exhibit low contact resistances and Schottky barrier heights (‚àº10 kŒ© Œºm at 3 K and 1.7 meV). Efficient carrier injection enables high carrier mobilities (‚àº190 cm2 V-1 s-1) and observation of resonant tunnelling.

Our results reveal significant advances toward high-performance WS2 devices using indium alloy contacts.  ¬© 2020 American Chemical Society.;
A Wideband Low-Power Cryogenic CMOS Circulator for Quantum Applications;Quantum computers require classical electronics to ensure fault-tolerant operation. To address compactness and scalability it was proposed to implement such electronics as integrated circuits operating at cryogenic temperatures close to those at which quantum bits (qubits) operate. Circulators are among the most common blocks used in the qubit readout chain but they are currently discrete devices with a bulky footprint thus preventing large-scale system integration. For this reason we present here a detailed description of the first fully integrated CMOS circulator operating from 300 K down to 4.2 K to be an integral part of cryogenic quantum computing platforms. At 300 K the circuit's operating frequency is centered around 6.5 GHz with 28% fractional bandwidth and it has 2.2-dB insertion loss 2.4-dB noise figure and 18-dB isolation while consuming 2.5-mW core power. These results are achieved thanks to a fully passive architecture based on LC all-pass filters which allows achieving a 1.6\times increase in fractional bandwidth and the lowest power consumption with respect to the state of the art while using only 0.45 mm2 of core area. This allows miniaturization of circulators in power-constrained multi-qubit readout systems. ¬© 1966-2012 IEEE.;
Quantum Computer Architecture: Towards Full-Stack Quantum Accelerators;This paper presents the definition and implementation of a quantum computer architecture to enable creating a new computational device - a quantum computer as an accelerator. A key question addressed is what such a quantum computer is and how it relates to the classical processor that controls the entire execution process. In this paper we present explicitly the idea of a quantum accelerator which contains the full stack of the layers of an accelerator. Such a stack starts at the highest level describing the target application of the accelerator. The next layer abstracts the quantum logic outlining the algorithm that is to be executed on the quantum accelerator. In our case the logic is expressed in the universal quantum-classical hybrid computation language developed in the group called OpenQL which visualised the quantum processor as a computational accelerator. The OpenQL compiler translates the program to a common assembly language called cQASM which can be executed on a quantum simulator. The cQASM represents the instruction set that can be executed by the micro-architecture implemented in the quantum accelerator. We propose that the industrial and societal application developers use perfect qubits that have no decoherence or error-rates. The perfect qubits offers facilities to the quantum application developer and they are not blocked by issues such as decoherence. ¬© 2020 EDAA.;

Realising high-dimensional quantum secret sharing with structured photons;Quantum secret sharing (QSS) is a cryptographic multiparty communication technique in which a secret is divided and shared among N parties and then securely reconstructed by (N-1) cooperating parties making it perfect for storing and sharing highly sensitive data. Challenges in high dimensional state preparation transformation and detection the key steps of any QSS protocol have so far hindered experimental realisation. Here by taking advantage of the high-dimensional encoding space accessible by a photon‚Äôs orbital angular momentum we present a toolbox for realising practical high-dimensional single photon QSS schemes that are easily scalable in both dimension and number of participants. Our implementations realised a new record in both the number of participants (N=10) and the dimensionality (d=11) with the latter facilitating the transfer of 2.89 bits of information per photon. This work is an important step towards securely distributing information across a network of nodes. ¬© 2020 SPIE.;
Improved Mapping of Quantum Circuits to IBM QX Architectures;Quantum computers are becoming a reality today due to the rapid progress made by researchers in the last years. In the process of building quantum computers IBM has developed several versions-starting from 5-qubit architectures like IBM QX2 and IBM QX4 to larger 16-or 20-qubit architectures. These architectures support arbitrary rotations of a single qubit and a controlled negation (CNOT) involving two qubits. The two qubit operations come with added coupling-map restrictions that only allow specific physical qubits to be the control and target qubits of the operation. In order to execute a quantum circuit on the IBM QX architecture CNOT gates must satisfy the so-called coupling constraints of the architecture. Previous works addressed this issue with the objective of reducing the number of gates and the circuit depth. However in this article we show that further improvements are possible. To this end we present a general approach for further improving the number of gate operations and depth of the mapped circuit. The proposed approach encompasses the selection of physical qubits determining initial and local permutations efficiently to obtain the final circuit mapped to the given IBM QX architecture. Through experiments improvements are observed over existing methods in terms of the number of gates and circuit depth.  ¬© 1982-2012 IEEE.;
Sparcl: A language for partially-invertible computation;"Invertibility is a fundamental concept in computer science with various manifestations in software development (serializer/deserializer parser/printer redo/undo compressor/decompressor and so on). Full invertibility necessarily requires bijectivity but the direct approach of composing bijective functions to develop invertible programs is too restrictive to be useful. In this paper we take a different approach by focusing on partially-invertible functions - functions that become invertible if some of their arguments are fixed. The simplest example of such is addition which becomes invertible when fixing one of the operands. More involved examples include entropy-based compression methods (e.g. Huffman coding) which carry the occurrence frequency of input symbols (in certain formats such as Huffman tree) and fixing this frequency information makes the compression methods invertible. We develop a language Sparcl for programming such functions in a natural way where partial-invertibility is the norm and bijectivity is a special case hence gaining significant expressiveness without compromising correctness. The challenge in designing such a language is to allow ordinary programming (the partially""part) to interact with the invertible part freely and yet guarantee invertibility by construction. The language Sparcl is linear-typed and has a type constructor to distinguish data that are subject to invertible computation and those that are not. We present the syntax type system and semantics of the language and prove that Sparcl correctly guarantees invertibility for its programs. We demonstrate the expressiveness of Sparcl with examples including tree rebuilding from preorder and inorder traversals and Huffman coding.  ¬© 2020 Owner/Author.""";

Semiconductor-Ferromagnetic Insulator-Superconductor Nanowires: Stray Field and Exchange Field;Nanowires can serve as flexible substrates for hybrid epitaxial growth on selected facets allowing for the design of heterostructures with complex material combinations and geometries. In this work we report on hybrid epitaxy of freestanding vapor-liquid-solid grown and in-plane selective area grown semiconductor-ferromagnetic insulator-superconductor (InAs/EuS/Al) nanowire heterostructures. We study the crystal growth and complex epitaxial matching of wurtzite and zinc-blende InAs/rock-salt EuS interfaces as well as rock-salt EuS/face-centered cubic Al interfaces. Because of the magnetic anisotropy originating from the nanowire shape the magnetic structure of the EuS phase is easily tuned into single magnetic domains. This effect efficiently ejects the stray field lines along the nanowires. With tunnel spectroscopy measurements of the density of states we show that the material has a hard induced superconducting gap and magnetic hysteretic evolution which indicates that the magnetic exchange fields are not negligible. These hybrid nanowires fulfill key material requirements for serving as a platform for spin-based quantum applications such as scalable topological quantum computing.

Photolithographic Patterning of Organic Color-Centers;Organic color-centers (OCCs) have emerged as promising single-photon emitters for solid-state quantum technologies chemically specific sensing and near-infrared bioimaging. However these quantum light sources are currently synthesized in bulk solution lacking the spatial control required for on-chip integration. The ability to pattern OCCs on solid substrates with high spatial precision and molecularly defined structure is essential to interface electronics and advance their quantum applications. Herein a lithographic generation of OCCs on solid-state semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotube films at spatially defined locations is presented. By using light-driven diazoether chemistry it is possible to directly pattern p-nitroaryl OCCs which demonstrate chemically specific spectral signatures at programmed positions as confirmed by Raman mapping and hyperspectral photoluminescence imaging. This light-driven technique enables the fabrication of OCC arrays on solid films that fluoresce in the shortwave infrared and presents an important step toward the direct writing of quantum emitters and other functionalities at the molecular level. ¬© 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Quantum turing machines: Computations and measurements;"Contrary to the classical case the relation between quantum programming languages and quantum Turing Machines (QTM) has not been fully investigated. In particular there are features of QTMs that have not been exploited a notable example being the intrinsic infinite nature of any quantum computation. In this paper we propose a definition of QTM which extends and unifies the notions of Deutsch and Bernstein & Vazirani. In particular we allow both arbitrary quantum input and meaningful superpositions of computations where some of them are terminated"" with an ""output"" while others are not. For some infinite computations an ""output"" is obtained as a limit of finite portions of the computation. We propose a natural and robust observation protocol for our QTMs which does not modify the probability of the possible outcomes of the machines. Finally we use QTMs to define a class of quantum computable functions-any such function is a mapping from a general quantum state to a probability distribution of natural numbers. We expect that our class of functions when restricted to classical input-output will not be different from the set of the recursive functions. ¬© 2020 by the authors.""";
Extending XACC for Quantum Optimal Control;Quantum computing vendors are beginning to open up application programming interfaces for direct pulse-level quantum control. With this programmers can begin to describe quantum kernels of execution via sequences of arbitrary pulse shapes. This opens new avenues of research and development with regards to smart quantum compilation routines that enable direct translation of higher-level digital assembly representations to these native pulse instructions. In this work we present an extension to the XACC system-level quantum-classical software framework that directly enables this compilation lowering phase via user-specified quantum optimal control techniques. This extension enables the translation of digital quantum circuit representations to equivalent pulse sequences that are optimal with respect to the backend system dynamics. Our work is modular and extensible enabling third party optimal control techniques and strategies in both C++ and Python. We demonstrate this extension with familiar gradient-based methods like gradient ascent pulse engineering (GRAPE) gradient optimization of analytic controls (GOAT) and Krotov's method. Our work serves as a foundational component of future quantum-classical compiler designs that lower high-level programmatic representations to low-level machine instructions. ¬© 2020 IEEE.;

An Efficient Quantum Computing technique for cracking RSA using Shor's Algorithm;Quantum Computing is a prominent word in this era as it allows computation to be performed in no time. The motive of using Quantum Computing (QC) is that even exponentially large number of problems can be solved using it which was earlier difficult with the classical computing. Conventional methods are based on usage of bits which consist of 0's and 1's while QC works with qubits. The main issue is that conventional computing has issue of storage as well as computation even when parallel computation is performed on it. Concept of quantum parallelism allows the computation to be performed in exponentially very low time as compared to conventional method. This paper will discuss about Quantum Computing Algorithms and how Shor's algorithm is able to break RSA algorithms is discussed. Entanglement and superposition of qubits helps fast computation. The demonstration of the applicability has been evaluated based on Computation time storage capacity accuracy confidentiality efficiency integrity and availability. Among various algorithms Shor's technique is able to break various encryption algorithm with more supremacy as compared to conventional computing methods. In nutshell paper will discuss about various QC algorithms and will illustrate how shor's algorithm is able to crack RSA. ¬© 2020 IEEE.;
Testing of Code-Based Pseudorandom Number Generators for Post-Quantum Application;This article presents the results of studies of design pseudorandom sequence generators using code-based cryptosystems. The resistance of this generators type is based on the complexity of solving the syndrome decoding problem which allows to provide resistance to classic cryptanalysis and cryptanalysis using quantum computing. The article describes the principles of constructing a classic Fisher-Stern generator and proposes a new approach to design a code-based generator that can be applied in the post-quantum period. Heuristic testing of the presented generators was also conducted in terms of a period length a sequence generation speed and a resistance of the generators which revealed the Fisher-Stern generator deficiency. It is a difference between a theoretical and a practical period of the generated sequences which is eliminated in the proposed generator by adding two components: a linear feedback shift register and an adder. ¬© 2020 IEEE.;

Just like the real thing: Fast weak simulation of quantum computation;Quantum computers promise significant speedups in solving problems intractable for conventional computers but despite recent progress remain limited in scaling and availability. Therefore quantum software and hardware development heavily rely on simulation that runs on conventional computers. Most such approaches perform strong simulation in that they explicitly compute amplitudes of quantum states. However such information is not directly observable from a physical quantum computer because quantum measurements produce random samples from probability distributions defined by those amplitudes. In this work we focus on weak simulation that aims to produce outputs which are statistically indistinguishable from those of error-free quantum computers. We develop algorithms for weak simulation based on quantum state representation in terms of decision diagrams. We compare them to using state-vector arrays and binary search on prefix sums to perform sampling. Empirical validation shows for the first time that this enables mimicking of physical quantum computers of significant scale. ¬© 2020 IEEE.;
Projection-based runtime assertions for testing and debugging Quantum programs;In this paper we propose Proq a runtime assertion scheme for testing and debugging quantum programs on a quantum computer. The predicates in Proq are represented by projections (or equivalently closed subspaces of the state space) following Birkhoff-von Neumann quantum logic. The satisfaction of a projection by a quantum state can be directly checked upon a small number of projective measurements rather than a large number of repeated executions. On the theory side we rigorously prove that checking projection-based assertions can help locate bugs or statistically assure that the semantic function of the tested program is close to what we expect for both exact and approximate quantum programs. On the practice side we consider hardware constraints and introduce several techniques to transform the assertions making them directly executable on the measurement-restricted quantum computers. We also propose to achieve simplified assertion implementation using local projection technique with soundness guaranteed. We compare Proq with existing quantum program assertions and demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of Proq by its applications to assert two sophisticated quantum algorithms the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd algorithm and Shor's algorithm. ¬© 2020 Owner/Author.;
Simulation of the Schr√∂dinger particle non-elastic scattering with emission of photon in the quantum register;This paper investigates whether a quantum computer can efficiently simulate the non-elastic scattering of the Schr√∂dinger particle on a stationary excitable shield. The return of the shield to the ground state is caused by photon emission. An algorithm is presented for simulating the time evolution of such a process implemented on standard two-input gates. The algorithm is used for the computation of elastic and non-elastic scattering probabilities. The results obtained by our algorithm are compared with those obtained using the standard Cayley‚Äôs method. ¬© 2020 Polish Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.;
A 1.2-V 6-GHz Dual-Path Charge-Pump PLL Frequency Synthesizer for Quantum Control and Readout in CMOS 65-nm Process;This paper presents a low jitter dual-path charge-pump phase locked loop (PLL) synthesizer in a CMOS 65-nm process for quantum readout applications. The PLL incorporates a programmable dual charge-pump and a loop filter with both proportional and integral paths that can be driven independently providing flexible control of the loop bandwidth to achieve low jitter performance.

Limitations of error corrected quantum annealing in improving the performance of Boltzmann machines;Boltzmann machines a class of machine learning models are the basis of several deep learning methods that have been successfully applied to both supervised and unsupervised machine learning tasks. These models assume that some given dataset is generated according to a Boltzmann distribution and the goal of the training procedure is to learn the set of parameters that most closely match the input data distribution. Training such models is difficult due to the intractability of traditional sampling techniques and proposals using quantum annealers for sampling hope to mitigate the cost associated with sampling. However real physical devices will inevitably be coupled to the environment and the strength of this coupling affects the effective temperature of the distributions from which a quantum annealer samples. To counteract this problem error correction schemes that can effectively reduce the temperature are needed if there is to be some benefit in using quantum annealing for problems at a larger scale where we might expect the effective temperature of the device to be too high. To this end we have applied nested quantum annealing correction (NQAC) to do unsupervised learning with a small bars and stripes dataset and to do supervised learning with a coarse-grained MNIST dataset which consists of black-and-white images of hand-written integers. For both datasets we demonstrate improved training and a concomitant effective temperature reduction at higher noise levels relative to the unencoded case. We also find better performance overall with longer anneal times and offer an interpretation of the results based on a comparison to simulated quantum annealing and spin vector Monte Carlo. A counterintuitive aspect of our results is that the output distribution generally becomes less Gibbs-like with increasing nesting level and increasing anneal times which shows that improved training performance can be achieved without equilibration to the target Gibbs distribution.  ¬© 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.;

Quantum Computer Architecture Toward Full-Stack Quantum Accelerators;This article presents the definition and implementation of a quantum computer architecture to enable creating a new computational device‚Äîa quantum computer as an accelerator. A key question addressed is what such a quantum computer is and how it relates to the classical processor that controls the entire execution process. In this article we present explicitly the idea of a quantum accelerator that contains the full stack of the layers of an accelerator. Such a stack starts at the highest level describing the target application of the accelerator. The next layer abstracts the quantum logic outlining the algorithm that is to be executed on the quantum accelerator. In our case the logic is expressed in the universal quantum-classical hybrid computation language developed in the group called OpenQL which visualized the quantum processor as a computational accelerator. The OpenQL compiler translates the program to a common assembly language called cQASM which can be executed on a quantum simulator. The cQASM represents the instruction set that can be executed by the microarchitecture implemented in the quantum accelerator. In a subsequent step the compiler can convert the cQASM to generate the eQASM which is executable on a particular experimental device incorporating the platform-specific parameters. This way we are able to distinguish clearly the experimental research toward better qubits and the industrial and societal applications that need to be developed and executed on a quantum device. The first case offers experimental physicists with a full-stack experimental platform using realistic qubits with decoherence and error-rates whereas the second case offers perfect qubits to the quantum application developer where there is neither decoherence nor error-rates. We conclude the article by explicitly presenting three examples of full-stack quantum accelerators for an experimental superconducting processor for quantum accelerated genome sequencing and for near-term generic optimization problems based on quantum heuristic approaches. The two later full-stack models are currently being actively researched in our group. ¬© 2021 IEEE.;
An investigation on support vector clustering for big data in quantum paradigm;The support vector clustering algorithm is a well-known clustering algorithm based on support vector machines using Gaussian or polynomial kernels. The classical support vector clustering algorithm works well in general but its performance degrades when applied on big data. In this paper we have investigated the performance of support vector clustering algorithm implemented in a quantum paradigm for possible runtime improvements. We have developed and analyzed a quantum version of the support vector clustering algorithm. The proposed approach is based on the quantum support vector machine [1] and quantum kernels (i.e. Gaussian and polynomial). The classical support vector clustering algorithm converges in O(M2N) runtime complexity where M is the number of input objects and N is the dimension of the feature space. Our proposed quantum version converges in ‚àº O(log MN) runtime complexity. The clustering identification phase with adjacency matrix exhibits O(M3lgM) runtime complexity in the quantum version whereas the runtime complexity in the classical implementation is O(M2). The proposed quantum version of the supportvector clustering method demonstrates a significant speedup gain on the overall runtime complexity as compared to the classical counterpart. ¬© 2020 Springer Science+Business Media LLC part of Springer Nature.;

In addition we walk through two platform-level enhancements parametric compilation and active qubit reset that specifically optimize a quantum-classical architecture to support variational hybrid algorithms the most promising applications of near-term quantum hardware. Finally we show that integrating these two features into the Rigetti Quantum Cloud Services platform results in considerable improvements to the latencies that govern algorithm runtime. ¬© 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.;
Realizing Quantum Algorithms on Real Quantum Computing Devices;Quantum computing is currently moving from an academic idea to a practical reality. Quantum computing in the cloud is already available and allows users from all over the world to develop and execute real quantum algorithms. However companies which are heavily investing in this new technology such as Google IBM Rigetti Intel IonQ and Xanadu follow diverse technological approaches. This led to a situation where we have substantially different quantum computing devices available thus far. They mostly differ in the number and kind of qubits and the connectivity between them. Because of that various methods for realizing the intended quantum functionality on a given quantum computing device are available. This paper provides an introduction and overview into this domain and describes corresponding methods also referred to as compilers mappers synthesizers transpilers or routers. ¬© 2020 EDAA.;
Quantum algorithms for typical hard problems: a perspective of cryptanalysis;In typical well-known cryptosystem the hardness of classical problems plays a fundamental role in ensuring its security. While with the booming of quantum computation some classical hard problems tend to be vulnerable when confronted with the already-known quantum attacks as a result it is necessary to develop the post-quantum cryptosystem to resist the quantum attacks. With the purpose to bridge the two disciplines it is significant to summarize known quantum algorithms and their threats toward these cryptographic intractable problems from a perspective of cryptanalysis. In this paper we discussed the designing methodology algorithm framework and latest progress of the mathematic hard problems on which the typical cryptosystems depend including integer factorization problem discrete logarithmic problem and its variants lattice problem dihedral hidden subgroup problems and extrapolated dihedral coset problem. It illustrated the reason why some cryptosystems such as RSA and ECC are not resistant to quantum attacks yet some of them like lattice cryptosystems remain intact facing quantum attacks. ¬© 2020 The Author(s).;
QCOR: A language extension specification for the heterogeneousquantum-classical model of computation;Quantum computing (QC) is an emerging computational paradigm that leverages the laws of quantum mechanics to perform elementary logic operations. Existing programming models for QC were designed with fault-tolerant hardware in mind envisioning stand-alone applications. However the susceptibility of near-term quantum computers to noise limits their stand-alone utility. To better leverage limited computational strengths of noisy quantum devices hybrid algorithms have been suggested whereby quantum computers are used in tandem with their classical counterparts in a heterogeneous fashion. This modus operandi calls out for a programming model and a high-level programming language that natively and seamlessly supports heterogeneous quantum-classical hardware architectures in a single-source-code paradigm. Motivated by the lack of such a model we introduce a language extension specification called QCOR which enables single-source quantum-classical programming. Programs written using the QCOR library-based language extensions can be compiled to produce functional hybrid binary executables. After defining QCOR's programming model memory model and execution model we discuss how QCOR enables variational iterative and feed-forward QC. QCOR approaches quantum-classical computation in a hardware-agnostic heterogeneous fashion and strives to build on best practices of high-performance computing. The high level of abstraction in the language extension is intended to accelerate the adoption of QC by researchers familiar with classical high-performance computing. ¬© 2020 ACM.;
A Scalable Cryo-CMOS Controller for the Wideband Frequency-Multiplexed Control of Spin Qubits and Transmons;Building a large-scale quantum computer requires the co-optimization of both the quantum bits (qubits) and their control electronics. By operating the CMOS control circuits at cryogenic temperatures (cryo-CMOS) and hence in close proximity to the cryogenic solid-state qubits a compact quantum-computing system can be achieved thus promising scalability to the large number of qubits required in a practical application. This work presents a cryo-CMOS microwave signal generator for frequency-multiplexed control of 4\times 32 qubits (32 qubits per RF output). A digitally intensive architecture offering full programmability of phase amplitude and frequency of the output microwave pulses and a wideband RF front end operating from 2 to 20 GHz allow targeting both spin qubits and transmons. The controller comprises a qubit-phase-tracking direct digital synthesis (DDS) back end for coherent qubit control and a single-sideband (SSB) RF front end optimized for minimum leakage between the qubit channels. Fabricated in Intel 22-nm FinFET technology it achieves a 48-dB SNR and 45-dB spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) in a 1-GHz data bandwidth when operating at 3 K thus enabling high-fidelity qubit control. By exploiting the on-chip 4096-instruction memory the capability to translate quantum algorithms to microwave signals has been demonstrated by coherently controlling a spin qubit at both 14 and 18 GHz.  ¬© 1966-2012 IEEE.;
Qiskit pulse: Programming quantum computers through the cloud with pulses;The quantum circuit model is an abstraction that hides the underlying physical implementation of gates and measurements on a quantum computer. For precise control of real quantum hardware the ability to execute pulse and readout-level instructions is required. To that end we introduce Qiskit Pulse a pulse-level programming paradigm implemented as a module within Qiskit-Terra [1]. To demonstrate the capabilities of Qiskit Pulse we calibrate both un-echoed and echoed variants of the cross-resonance entangling gate with a pair of qubits on an IBM Quantum system accessible through the cloud. We perform Hamiltonian characterization of both single and two-pulse variants of the cross-resonance entangling gate with varying amplitudes on a cloud-based IBM Quantum system. We then transform these calibrated sequences into a high-fidelity CNOT gate by applying pre and post local-rotations to the qubits achieving average gate fidelities of F = 0.981 and F = 0.979 for the un-echoed and echoed respectively. This is comparable to the standard backend CNOT fidelity of F CX = 0.984. Furthermore to illustrate how users can access their results at different levels of the readout chain we build a custom discriminator to investigate qubit readout correlations. Qiskit Pulse allows users to explore advanced control schemes such as optimal control theory dynamical decoupling and error mitigation that are not available within the circuit model.  ¬© 2020 The Author(s).

Numerical analysis of subwavelength field effects in photonic crystal slab cavities;Surface coupling of single quantum emitters to optical cavities consisting of a photonic crystal slab is a delicate yet crucial task for photonic quantum applications. By coupling through the evanescent surface field only small Purcell factors can be achieved. Here we propose to introduce a pit in the slab to position the emitter closer to the mode field maximum. Photonic crystal slab L3 cavities are investigated with respect to quality factor and Purcell effect using finite element calculations in the frequency domain. That way the spatial distribution of the Purcell factor can be calculated. Introducing a small sized pit to the surface of the photonic crystal cavity can evoke subwavelength field effects confining the field maximum inside the pit. By engineering a pit in the center of the cavity the Purcell factor can be increased from 176 to 1331 albeit reducing the Q factor from 20769 to 16696. ¬© 2020 The Author(s).

Silicon-Based Group-IV O-E-O Devices for Gain Logic and Wavelength Conversion;"Using the strip-guided manufacturable"" SOI/GeSn group-IV integrated-photonics platform operating at 1550 nm we propose an optical-to-electrical-to-optical (O-E-O) device that can work either as an amplifierless optical repeater with gain as a linear-optics wavelength-converter repeater or as a new ""optical-optical"" logic (OOL) gate. An interconnected array of such linear-optics gates performs complicated digital-logic functions. The OEO comprises a photodetector (PD) an electro-optical modulator (EOM) and an electrical biasing-and-interconnect circuit. A digitally modulated optical signal is sent into a waveguided photoconductive GeSn PIN PD whose electrical output is compatible with the electrical input of a resonant bus-coupled Si PN-depletion microdisk EOM modulating a CW optical input beam. Our self-consistent physical model takes into account N and P doping effects. Assuming a peak optical input power of 0.5 mW and 3 V DC bias our 1.55 Œºm simulations predict successful repeater-converter operation at 6.5 GHz (13 Gbit/s) and successful OOL functioning at 4.7 GHz (9.4 Gbit/s) with 12-to-16 dB extinction ratio and switching energy in the 5.8 to 9.6 fJ/bit range. A further increase of the OOL bit rate to 14 Gbit/s is available at the expense of an increased optical signal power. ¬© 2020 American Chemical Society.""";
Electrical and Thermal Characterization for SOI p-type FinFET down to Sub-Kelvin Temperatures;Nowadays cryogenic electronics represents a very important research field thanks to significant efforts done so far.

Probabilistic open-destination teleportation based on SAM-Path-OAM hybrid entanglement W State;As a multi-particle entangled state W state is more robust than GHZ state because even if one of the entangled particles is traced out or projected to a specific state the remaining particles of W state are still entangled. In this paper we propose a novel scheme to generate hybrid W state entanglement where three photons entangled in spin angular momentum (SAM) path (line momentum) and orbital angular momentum (OAM). Based on the hybrid entanglement W state we present a probabilistic open-destination teleportation scheme in which Alice can remotely control the OAM generation of Bob's photon. Different from the original teleportation with certain probability the specified state can be transmit to any photon of the multi-particle entanglement and its information can be obtained from any individual DOF of OAM or linear momentum depending on postprocessing. At last we evaluate the performance of this scheme using quantum state tomography and we find Bob's OAM state not only electrically tuned by Alice but also depend on the linear momentum (path) of the W state and the polarization of Carol's photon. ¬© 2020 Elsevier GmbH;
An open-source industrial-strength optimizing compiler for quantum programs;Quilc is an open-source optimizing compiler for gate-based quantum programs written in Quil or QASM two popular quantum programming languages. The compiler was designed with attention toward NISQ-era quantum computers specifically recognizing that each quantum gate has a non-negligible and often irrecoverable cost toward a program's successful execution. Quilc's primary goal is to make authoring quantum software a simpler exercise by making architectural details less burdensome to the author. Using Quilc allows one to write programs faster while usually not compromising - and indeed sometimes improving - their execution fidelity on a given hardware architecture. In this paper we describe many of the principles behind Quilc's design and demonstrate the compiler with various examples. ¬© 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.;
OpenFermion: The electronic structure package for quantum computers;Quantum simulation of chemistry and materials is predicted to be an important application for both near-term and fault-tolerant quantum devices. However at present developing and studying algorithms for these problems can be difficult due to the prohibitive amount of domain knowledge required in both the area of chemistry and quantum algorithms. To help bridge this gap and open the field to more researchers we have developed the OpenFermion software package (www.openfermion.org). OpenFermion is an open-source software library written largely in Python under an Apache 2.0 license aimed at enabling the simulation of fermionic and bosonic models and quantum chemistry problems on quantum hardware. Beginning with an interface to common electronic structure packages it simplifies the translation between a molecular specification and a quantum circuit for solving or studying the electronic structure problem on a quantum computer minimizing the amount of domain expertise required to enter the field. The package is designed to be extensible and robust maintaining high software standards in documentation and testing. This release paper outlines the key motivations behind design choices in OpenFermion and discusses some basic OpenFermion functionality which we believe will aid the community in the development of better quantum algorithms and tools for this exciting area of research.  ¬© 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.;
Entanglement-Enhanced Communication Networks;Building quantum networks ultimately requires strong use cases.

One might think quantum secure communication would be such a use case but the entire design of the current Internet is built on the end-to-end argument and may reject the idea of implementing security as a physical layer protocol. On the other hand higher data rates and reduced latency have been successfully used as key arguments for the conception of new communication standards. We thus argue that exactly these two figures of merit should be used again. We define two new initial stages of development of the quantum Internet where in the first phase entanglement is only generated and used between network nodes and in second phase entanglement swapping and thus distribution of entanglement over increasing distances becomes possible. In both phases we show by simulation how the available new protocols increase the network capacity. Interestingly following this envisioned approach can serve the needs of current market participants while paving the road for fully quantum applications in the future. ¬© 2020 IEEE.;
Towards classification of experimental Laguerre-Gaussian modes using convolutional neural networks;Automated detection of orbital angular momentum (OAM) can tremendously contribute to quantum optical experiments. We develop convolutional neural networks to identify and classify noisy images of Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) modes collected from two different experimental set ups. We investigate the classification performance measures of the predictive classification models for experimental conditions. The results demonstrate accuracy and specificity above 90% in classifying 16 LG modes for both experimental set ups. However the F-score sensitivity and precision of the classification range from 57% to 92% depending on the number of imperfections in the images obtained from the experiments. This research could enhance the application of OAM light in telecommunications sensing and high-resolution imaging systems.  ¬© 2020 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).;

The chip comprises several beam splitters two SFWM entangled photon sources a pump filter integrated Mach‚Äì Zehnder interferometric gyro and an array of waveguide coupled GeSn/Ge/Si single-photon avalanche detectors. The laser pumped SWFM sources generate the signal-idler pairs which in turn are used to measure the two-photon four-photon and higher order coincidences resulting in an increasing of the gyro resolution by a factor of two and four with respect to the classical approach. ¬© 2020 by the authors.

Frequency Stabilization of Nanomechanical Resonators Using Thermally Invariant Strain Engineering;Microfabricated mechanical resonators enable precision measurement techniques from atomic force microscopy to emerging quantum applications. The resonance frequency-based physical sensing combines high precision with long-term stability. However widely used Si3N4 resonators suffer from frequency sensitivity to temperature due to the differential thermal expansion vs the Si substrates. Here we experimentally demonstrate temperature- and residual stress-insensitive 16.51 MHz tuning fork nanobeam resonators with nonlinear clamps defining the stress and frequency by design achieving a low fractional frequency sensitivity of (2.5 ¬± 0.8) √ó 10-6 K-1 a 72√ó reduction. On-chip optical readout of resonator thermomechanical fluctuations allows precision frequency measurement without any external excitation at the thermodynamically limited frequency Allan deviation of ‚âà7 Hz/Hz1/2 and (relative) bias stability of ‚âà10 Hz (‚âà 0.6 √ó 10-6) above 1 s averaging remarkably on par with state-of-the-art driven devices of similar mass. Both the resonator stabilization and the passive frequency readout can benefit a wide variety of micromechanical sensors. Copyright ¬© 2020 American Chemical Society.;
Quantum approximation for wireless scheduling;This paper proposes an application algorithm based on a quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) for wireless scheduling problems. QAOA is one of the promising hybrid quantum-classical algorithms to solve combinatorial optimization problems and it provides great approximate solutions to non-deterministic polynomial-time (NP) hard problems. QAOA maps the given problem into Hilbert space and then it generates the Hamiltonian for the given objective and constraint. Then QAOA finds proper parameters from the classical optimization loop in order to optimize the expectation value of the generated Hamiltonian. Based on the parameters the optimal solution to the given problem can be obtained from the optimum of the expectation value of the Hamiltonian. Inspired by QAOA a quantum approximate optimization for scheduling (QAOS) algorithm is proposed. The proposed QAOS designs the Hamiltonian of the wireless scheduling problem which is formulated by the maximum weight independent set (MWIS). The designed Hamiltonian is converted into a unitary operator and implemented as a quantum gate operation. After that the iterative QAOS sequence solves the wireless scheduling problem. The novelty of QAOS is verified with simulation results implemented via Cirq and TensorFlow-Quantum. ¬© 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI Basel Switzerland.;
Highly Photostable Perovskite Nanocubes: Toward Integrated Single Photon Sources Based on Tapered Nanofibers;The interest in perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) such as CsPbBr3 for quantum applications is rapidly raising as it has been demonstrated that they can behave as very efficient single photon emitters. The main problem to tackle in this context is their photostability under optical excitation. In this article we present a full analysis of the optical and quantum properties of highly efficient perovskite nanocubes synthesized with an established method which is used for the first time to produce quantum emitters and is shown to ensure increased photostability. These emitters exhibit reduced blinking together with a strong photon antibunching. Remarkably these features are hardly affected by the increase of the excitation intensity well above the emission saturation levels. Finally we achieve for the first time the coupling of a single perovskite nanocube with a tapered optical nanofiber in order to aim for a compact integrated single photon source for future applications.

Resource-Efficient Quantum Computing by Breaking Abstractions;Building a quantum computer that surpasses the computational power of its classical counterpart is a great engineering challenge. Quantum software optimizations can provide an accelerated pathway to the first generation of quantum computing (QC) applications that might save years of engineering effort. Current quantum software stacks follow a layered approach similar to the stack of classical computers which was designed to manage the complexity. In this review we point out that greater efficiency of QC systems can be achieved by breaking the abstractions between these layers. We review several works along this line including two hardware-aware compilation optimizations that break the quantum instruction set architecture (ISA) abstraction and two error-correction/information-processing schemes that break the qubit abstraction. Last we discuss several possible future directions.  ¬© 1963-2012 IEEE.;
Challenges and Opportunities of Near-Term Quantum Computing Systems;The concept of quantum computing has inspired a whole new generation of scientists including physicists engineers and computer scientists to fundamentally change the landscape of information technology. With experimental demonstrations stretching back more than two decades the quantum computing community has achieved a major milestone over the past few years: the ability to build systems that are stretching the limits of what can be classically simulated and which enable cloud-based research for a wide range of scientists thus increasing the pool of talent exploring early quantum systems. While such noisy near-term quantum computing systems fall far short of the requirements for fault-tolerant systems they provide unique test beds for exploring the opportunities for quantum applications. Here we highlight an IBM-specific perspective of the facets associated with these systems including quantum software cloud access benchmarking quantum systems error correction and mitigation in such systems understanding the complexity of quantum circuits and how early quantum applications can run on near-term quantum computers.  ¬© 1963-2012 IEEE.;
Experimental pairwise entanglement estimation for an N-qubit system: A machine learning approach for programming quantum hardware;Designing and implementing algorithms for medium- and large-scale quantum computers is not easy. In the previous work we have suggested and developed the idea of using machine learning techniques to train a quantum system such that the desired process is ‚Äúlearned‚Äù thus obviating the algorithm design difficulty. This works quite well for small systems. But the goal is macroscopic physical computation. Here we implement our learned pairwise entanglement witness on Microsoft‚Äôs Q# one of the commercially available gate model quantum computer simulators we perform statistical analysis to determine reliability and reproducibility and we show that after training the system in stages for an incrementing number of qubits (2 3 4..) we can infer the pattern for mesoscopic N from simulation results for three- four- five- six- and seven-qubit systems. Our results suggest a fruitful pathway for general quantum computer algorithm design and for practical computation on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. ¬© 2020 Springer Science+Business Media LLC part of Springer Nature.;
Flexible Cloud/User-Centric Entanglement and Photon Pair Distribution with Synthesizable Optical Router;The practical roll-out of quantum communication technologies in optical networks and the adoption of novel quantum applications demand the distribution of single or entangled photons. Flexibility and dynamicity are paramount for the provision of quantum resources in order to scale with the number of users and to meet the demand of complex network architectures. We present a quantum network architecture that features this degree of reconfigurability without being restricted to a rigid physical-layer network based on purely passive multiplexing componentry. We leverage spectral assets of photon-pair sources from the short-wavelength band to the L-band and agile spatial switching at a remote optical network node in order to realize a flexible distribution map that features different flavors reaching from cloud-centric to user-centric quantum connectivity. Photon pair distribution is experimentally demonstrated between five users in a 17-km reach tree-shaped optical network with high visibility entanglement shared between three users of the network. Simultaneous distribution of photons to more than one user is enabled and the delivered photon rate can be dynamically adjusted. Penalty-free operation is confirmed for integrating a co-existing classical control channel within the quantum. ¬© 1995-2012 IEEE.;
Sharp-selectivity in-line topology low temperature superconducting bandpass filter for superconducting quantum applications;This paper presents a new class of sharp-selectivity low-Temperature superconducting filter that incorporates lumped element resonant couplings. Dependent on a novel synthesis approach the proposed filter exhibits great advantages such as: (1) a very simple in-line topology (without any cross coupling) (2) extremely compact size based on lumped inductor-capacitor (LC) elements and (3) multiple transmission zeros (TZs) independently generated and controlled (via each resonant coupling). To facilitate the physical implementation a group of lumped element circuit models are detailed where series LC units are adopted for both the resonators and the resonant couplings. Considering an in-line topology here the entire filter layout is then designed by cascading the lumped models one after another. For verification a 5th-order bandpass filter centered at 5 GHz with 500 MHz bandwidth and 3 TZs is designed simulated and tested at cryogenic temperature (4.2 K). Moreover preliminary simulations of the presented filter in series with an on-chip rapid single-flux-quantum microwave pulse generator are discussed for superconducting quantum applications. ¬© 2020 The Author(s).

Experimental observation of multiple vortices in high-order laser mode induced by intracavity modulated resonator;Optical vortices with orbital angular momentum(OAM) have attracted increasing attention and the generation of multi-vortices is of great importance and the high-order Gauss mode has been a research hotspot in recent years. Therefore the external cavity high-order He-Ne resonator in this paper directly generates various high-order Gauss multi-OAM vortex beams. By only adding the wire to disturb the oscillation of the resonator and adjusting the transverse or longitudinal inclination of the mirror we can destroy the symmetry of the resonator and obtain high-order vortex beams with different numbers of vortices. The laser cavity can directly and controllably generate high-order Gauss vortex or non-vortex beam. The experiment has good robustness and easy operation and has broad application prospects in optical communications. It will be used to realize orbital angular momentum multiplexing communication. ¬© 2020;
32;NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) computing requires error mitigation to achieve meaningful computation. Our compilation tool development focuses on the fact that the error rates of individual qubits are not equal with a goal of maximizing the success probability of real-world subroutines such as an adder circuit. We begin by establishing a metric for choosing among possible paths and circuit alternatives for executing gates between variables placed far apart within the processor and test our approach on two IBM 20-qubit systems named Tokyo and Poughkeepsie. We find that a single-number metric describing the fidelity of individual gates is a useful but imperfect guide. Our compiler uses this subsystem and maps complete circuits onto the machine using a beam search-based heuristic that will scale as processor and program sizes grow. To evaluate the whole compilation process we compiled and executed adder circuits then calculated the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL-divergence a measure of the distance between two probability distributions). For a circuit within the capabilities of the hardware our compilation increases estimated success probability and reduces KL-divergence relative to an error-oblivious placement.  ¬© 2020 ACM.;
Low-decoherence quantum information transmittal scheme based on the single-particle various degrees of freedom entangled states;In this paper aiming at the problem that the quality of quantum encoding channels will get worse with transmittal distance increasing owing to the interaction between environmental noises and quantum systems. A new low-decoherence quantum information deferent scheme is proposed on the basis of the single-particle diverse degrees of freedom entangled states from dissimilar perspectivesits encoding channel and transmittal distance are separated. It can reduce amounts of noise interference in the information transmittal process from the origin by entanglement in various degrees of freedom of the single-particle thus can better resist channel‚Äôs decoherence and has better deferent characteristics compared with other schemes. Besides it can also solve the difficulty that cannot concurrently generate multiple remote entanglement pairs by preparation many single-particle entangling in different degrees of freedom. In sum our proposed scheme is beneficial to promote the development of quantum information transmission and has a good innovation. ¬© 2020 Springer Science+Business Media LLC part of Springer Nature.;
Local Equivalence of Multipartite Entanglement;Let R be an invariant polynomial ring of a reductive group acting on a vector space and let d be the minimum integer such that R is generated by those polynomials in R of degree no more than d. To upper bound such d is a long standing open problem since the very initial study of the invariant theory in the 19th century. Motivated by its significant role in characterizing multipartite entanglement we study the invariant polynomial rings of local unitary groups-the direct product of unitary groups acting on the tensor product of Hilbert spaces and local general linear groups-the direct product of general linear groups acting on the tensor product of Hilbert spaces. For these two group actions we prove explicit upper bounds on the degrees needed to generate the corresponding invariant polynomial rings. On the other hand systematic methods are provided to construct all homogeneous polynomials that are invariant under these two groups for any fixed degree. Thus our results can be regarded as a complete characterization of the invariant polynomial rings. As an interesting application we show that multipartite entanglement is additive in the sense that two multipartite states are local unitary equivalent if and only if r-copies of them are local unitary equivalent for some r. ¬© 2020 IEEE.;
Frequency-doubled vortex beam emitter based on nonlinear Cherenkov radiation;In this work we propose a new scheme to generate frequency-doubled vortex beams from a radially poled LiNbO3 micro-ring resonator based on nonlinear Cherenkov radiation. The near-infrared fundamental wave is resonant in the micro-ring while the second harmonic is emitted from the resonator along the Cherenkov phase-matching direction. The topological charge of the emitted second-harmonic vortex beam is determined by both the azimuthal order of the whispering galley modes and the number of nonlinear grating elements. The field distribution and the conversion efficiency of the emitted vortex beam are investigated. ¬© 2020 Chinese Optics Letters.;
Boolean satisfiability in quantum compilation;Quantum compilation is the task of translating a quantum algorithm implemented in a high-level quantum programming language into a technology-dependent instructions flow for a physical quantum computer. To tackle the large gap between the quantum program and the low-level instructions quantum compilation is split into a multi-stage flow consisting of several layers of abstraction. Several different individual tasks have been proposed for the layers in the flow many of them are NP-hard. In this article we will describe the flow and we will propose algorithms based on Boolean satisfiability which is a good match to tackle such computationally complex problems. ¬© 2019 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Post-Quantum Authentication in TLS 1.3: A Performance Study;The potential development of large-scale quantum computers is raising concerns among IT and security research professionals due to their ability to solve (elliptic curve) discrete logarithm and integer factorization problems in polynomial time. All currently used public key algorithms would be deemed insecure in a post-quantum (PQ) setting. In response the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has initiated a process to standardize quantum-resistant crypto algorithms focusing primarily on their security guarantees. Since PQ algorithms present significant differences over classical ones their overall evaluation should not be performed out-of-context. This work presents a detailed performance evaluation of the NIST signature algorithm candidates and investigates the imposed latency on TLS 1.3 connection establishment under realistic network conditions. In addition we investigate their impact on TLS session throughput and analyze the trade-off between lengthy PQ signatures and computationally heavy PQ cryptographic operations. Our results demonstrate that the adoption of at least two PQ signature algorithms would be viable with little additional overhead over current signature algorithms. Also we argue that many NIST PQ candidates can effectively be used for less time-sensitive applications and provide an in-depth discussion on the integration of PQ authentication in encrypted tunneling protocols along with the related challenges improvements and alternatives. Finally we propose and evaluate the combination of different PQ signature algorithms across the same certificate chain in TLS. Results show a reduction of the TLS handshake time and a significant increase of a server's TLS tunnel connection rate over using a single PQ signature scheme. ¬© 2020 27th Annual Network and Distributed System Security Symposium NDSS 2020.

Communication cost of quantum processes;A common scenario in distributed computing involves a client who asks a server to perform a computation on a remote computer. An important problem is to determine the minimum amount of communication needed to specify the desired computation. Here we extend this problem to the quantum domain analyzing the total amount of (classical and quantum) communication needed by a server in order to accurately execute a quantum process chosen by a client from a parametric family of quantum processes. We derive a general lower bound on the communication cost establishing a relation with the precision limits of quantum metrology: If a v-dimensional family of processes can be estimated with mean squared error n-Œ≤ by using n parallel queries then the communication cost for n parallel executions of a process in the family is at least (Œ≤ v/2 - ‚àà) log n qubits at the leading order in n for every ‚àà > 0. For a class of quantum processes satisfying the standard quantum limit (Œ≤ = 1) we show that the bound can be attained by transmitting an approximate classical description of the desired process. For quantum processes satisfying the Heisenberg limit (Œ≤ = 2) our bound shows that the communication cost is at least twice as the cost of communicating standard quantum limited processes with the same number of parameters. ¬© 2020 IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Information Theory.All right reserved.;
Optical spin-dependent beam separation in cyclic group symmetric metasurface;Cross-polarization scattering of a circularly polarized beam from nano-rod introduces a geometric phase to the outgoing beam with opposite circular polarization. By manipulating the spatial array of subwavelength nano-structure constituting metasurface the geometric phase can be engineered to generate a variety of beam profiles including vortex beam carrying orbital angular momentum via a process called spin-to-orbital angular momentum conversion. Here we introduce a cyclic group symmetric metasurface composed of tapered arc nano-rods and explore how azimuthal angular distribution of total phase determines the feature of spin-dependent beam separation. When scattered from a circular array of tapered arc nano-rods possessing varying width with a fixed length a dynamical phase having non-constant azimuthal gradient is introduced to an incoming Gaussian beam. This leads to a spin-dependent beam separation in the outgoing vortex beam profile which is attributed to an azimuthal angle dependent destructive interference between scatterings from two plasmonic excitations along the width and the length of tapered arc nano-rod. Relation of cyclic group symmetry property of metasurface and the generated vortex beam profile is examined in detail by experimental measurement and analysis in terms of partial-wave expansion and non-constant azimuthal gradient of total phase. Capability of spatial beam profiling by spin-dependent beam separation in vortex beam generation has an important implication for spatial demultiplexing in optical communication utilizing optical angular momentum mode division multiplexing as well as for optical vortex tweezers and optical signal processing employing vortex beams. ¬© 2020 Yeon Ui Lee et al. published by De Gruyter Berlin/Boston 2020.;

An updated LLVM-based quantum research compiler with further OpenQASM support;Quantum computing is a rapidly growing field with the potential to change how we solve previously intractable problems. Emerging hardware is approaching a complexity that requires increasingly sophisticated programming and control. Scaffold is an older quantum programming language that was originally designed for resource estimation for far-future large quantum machines and ScaffCC is the corresponding LLVM-based compiler. For the first time we provide a full and complete overview of the language itself the compiler as well as its pass structure.

Liquid-Crystal-Mediated Geometric Phase: From Transmissive to Broadband Reflective Planar Optics;Planar optical elements that can manipulate the multidimensional physical parameters of light efficiently and compactly are highly sought after in modern optics and nanophotonics. In recent years the geometric phase induced by the photonic spin‚Äìorbit interaction has attracted extensive attention for planar optics due to its powerful beam shaping capability. The geometric phase can usually be generated via inhomogeneous anisotropic materials among which liquid crystals (LCs) have been a focus. Their pronounced optical properties and controllable and stimuli-responsive self-assembly behavior introduce new possibilities for LCs beyond traditional panel displays. Recent advances in LC-mediated geometric phase planar optics are briefly reviewed. First several recently developed photopatterning techniques are presented enabling the accurate fabrication of complicated LC microstructures. Subsequently nematic LC-based transmissive planar optical elements and chiral LC-based broadband reflective elements are reviewed systematically. Versatile functionalities are revealed from conventional beam steering and focusing to advanced structuring. Combining the geometric phase with structured LC materials offers a satisfactory platform for planar optics with desired functionalities and drastically extends exceptional applications of ordered soft matter.

Guiding Principle for Minor-Embedding in Simulated-Annealing-Based Ising Machines;We propose a novel type of minor-embedding (ME) in simulated-annealing-based Ising machines. The Ising machines can solve combinatorial optimization problems. Many combinatorial optimization problems are mapped to find the ground (lowest-energy) state of the logical Ising model. When connectivity is restricted on Ising machines ME is required for mapping from the logical Ising model to a physical Ising model which corresponds to a specific Ising machine. Herein we discuss the guiding principle of ME design to achieve a high performance in Ising machines. We derive the proposed ME based on a theoretical argument of statistical mechanics. The performance of the proposed ME is compared with two existing types of MEs for different benchmarking problems. Simulated annealing shows that the proposed ME outperforms existing MEs for all benchmarking problems especially when the distribution of the degree in a logical Ising model has a large standard deviation. This study validates the guiding principle of using statistical mechanics for ME to realize fast and high-precision solvers for combinatorial optimization problems. ¬© 2013 IEEE.;
Transmission of vector vortex beams in dispersive media;Scattering phenomena affect light propagation through any kind of medium from free space to biological tissues. Finding appropriate strategies to increase the robustness to scattering is the common requirement in developing both communication protocols and imaging systems. Recently structured light has attracted attention due to its seeming scattering resistance in terms of transmissivity and spatial behavior. Moreover correlation between optical polarization and orbital angular momentum (OAM) which characterizes the so-called vector vortex beams (VVBs) states seems to allow for the preservation of the polarization pattern. We extend the analysis by investigating both the spatial features and the polarization structure of vectorial optical vortexes propagating in scattering media with different concentrations. Among the observed features we find a sudden swift decrease in contrast ratio for Gaussian OAM and VVB modes for concentrations of the adopted scattering media exceeding 0.09%. Our analysis provides a more general and complete study on the propagation of structured light in dispersive and scattering media.  ¬© The Authors.

Codar: A contextual duration-aware qubit mapping for various NISQ devices;Quantum computing devices in the NISQ era share common features and challenges like limited connectivity between qubits. Since two-qubit gates are allowed on limited qubit pairs quantum compilers must transform original quantum programs to fit the hardware constraints. Previous works on qubit mapping assume different gates have the same execution duration which limits them to explore the parallelism from the program. To address this drawback we propose a Multi-architecture Adaptive Quantum Abstract Machine (maQAM) and a COntext-sensitive and Duration-Aware Remapping algorithm (Codar). The Codar remapper is aware of gate duration difference and program context enabling it to extract more parallelism from programs and speed up the quantum programs by 1.23 in simulation on average in different architectures and maintain the fidelity of circuits when running on OriginQ quantum noisy simulator. ¬© 2020 IEEE.;
Hybrid light collection;Diamond can host a variety of point defects some of which are already well known and utilized for quantum applications others are just coming up as new promising candidates. As quantum applications often require the interaction of a light field with a single or only a few emitters at the same time it is crucial to increase the number of collected photons as well as to tailor the interaction with the light field. After a brief discussion on how an increase of the detected photons would affect different quantum applications two different hybrid approaches including their respective experimental implementation are discussed in detail. First the concept of a bullseye antenna is discussed which mainly focuses on a simple and robust way to enhance the collection via free-space optics and into low collection angles. With this structure a collection efficiency of up to 85% into an NA of 0.9 could be realized. The second structure goes toward a fiber-coupled device in order to prototype a fully integrated single-photon source. Here a single defect center is coupled to an on-chip silica waveguide and its emitted photons are routed to single-mode fibers. ¬© 2020 Elsevier Inc.;
Ultra-High-Frequency Love Surface Acoustic Wave Device for Real-Time Sensing Applications;Love surface acoustic wave (L-SAW) devices are ideal for real-time sensing applications. High miniaturization and sensitivity are desirable in particular for point of care diagnostics or on-site measurements. It is possible to enhance both these parameters by increasing the working frequency of these devices but this is still a challenge. Indeed the ultra-high frequency (UHF) range has not been explored yet for L-SAW sensing devices because it requires non-trivial fabrication and measurement setup. Here we present a multiplexable highly miniaturized UHF L-SAW device for real-time sensing applications. The sensor performance was first tested with mixtures of different volume percentages of isopropyl alcohol (IPA) in water. Measurements of phase and amplitude (related to change of density and viscosity respectively) show higher sensitivity and dynamic range than a representative 100 MHz L-SAW sensor. Then we measured the adsorption kinetics of three different concentrations of bovine serum albumin (BSA) in water on the sensor surface demonstrating biomolecule detection. The all-electrical readout system as long as the small dimensions make the presented device particularly promising for portable UHF sensing platforms. Nonetheless the higher sensitivity and dynamic range obtained with respect to a representative 100 MHz L-SAW sensor as long as the real-time measurements of the BSA adsorption (with an estimated limit of detection of 90 ng/mm2) show that UHF Love SAW sensors have the potential to be used for bio-sensing applications such as point of care diagnostics. ¬© 2013 IEEE.;
Topologically protected broadband rerouting of propagating waves around complex objects;Achieving robust propagation and guiding of electromagnetic waves through complex and disordered structures is a major goal of modern photonics research for both classical and quantum applications. Although the realization of backscattering-free and disorder-immune guided waves has recently become possible through various photonic schemes inspired by topological insulators in condensed matter physics the interaction between such topologically protected guided waves and free-space propagating waves remains mostly unexplored especially in the context of scattering systems. Here we theoretically demonstrate that free-space propagating plane waves can be efficiently coupled into topological one-way surface waves which can seamlessly flow around sharp corners and electrically large barriers and release their energy back into free space in the form of leaky-wave radiation. We exploit this physical mechanism to realize topologically protected wave-rerouting around an electrically large impenetrable object of complex shape with transmission efficiency exceeding 90% over a relatively broad bandwidth. The proposed topological wave-rerouting scheme is based on a stratified structure composed of a topologically nontrivial magnetized plasmonic material coated by a suitable isotropic layer. Our results may open a new avenue in the field of topological photonics and electromagnetics for applications that require engineered interactions between guided waves and free-space propagating waves including for complex beam-routing systems and advanced stealth technology. More generally our work may pave the way for robust defect/damage-immune scattering and radiating systems. ¬© 2019 Francesco Monticone et al. published by De Gruyter Berlin/Boston.;
QuFlow: Visualizing parameter flow in quantum circuits for understanding quantum computation;With the rapid progress of quantum computation recently it attracts a substantial amount of people to learn quantum computation. Quantum computation differs a lot from classical computation. To help novices learn quantum computation we conducted a interview with people who are learning quantum computation and found that novices feel confused about 1) how quantum gates contribute to the final results in a complicated quantum circuit and 2) how the final results generate steps along the quantum circuits. Thus we present QuFlow an interactive visualization tool for teaching the fundamentals of quantum computation. Users can use it to build a quantum circuit then QuFlow will simulate the quantum circuit in a classical computer. After simulation QuFlow will not only present the final output results of quantum circuits but also shows how the parameters change along the quantum circuits. A qualitative user study was carried out among target users and the results suggested that QuFlow could be effective for learning quantum computation. ¬© 2018 IEEE.;
Quantum mechanics with patterns of light: Progress in high dimensional and multidimensional entanglement with structured light;"Quantum mechanics is now a mature topic dating back more than a century. During its scientific development it fostered many technological advances that now are integrated into our everyday lives. More recently over the past few decades the authors have seen the emergence of a second quantum revolution ushering in control of quantum states. Here the spatial modes of light patterns of light""hold tremendous potential: light is weakly interacting and so an attractive avenue for exploring entanglement preservation in open systems while spatial modes of light offer a route to high dimensional Hilbert spaces for larger encoding alphabets promising higher information capacity per photon better security and enhanced robustness to noise. Yet progress in harnessing high dimensional spatial mode entanglement remains in its infancy. Here the authors review the recent progress in this regard outlining the core concepts in a tutorial manner before delving into the advances made in creation manipulation and detection of such quantum states. The authors cover advances in using orbital angular momentum as well as vectorial states that are hybrid entangled combining spatial modes with polarization to form an infinite set of two-dimensional spaces: multidimensional entanglement. The authors highlight the exciting work in pushing the boundaries in both the dimension and the photon number before finally summarizing the open challenges and the questions that remain unanswered.  ¬© 2019 Author(s).""";
All-Fiber OAM Amplifier with High Purity and Broadband Spectrum Gain Based on Fused Taper Vortex-Beam Coupler;All-fiber orbital angular momentum (OAM) amplifier with high purity and broadband spectrum gain based on a fused taper vortex-beam coupler (VBC) has been studied. Active and passive few-mode fibers (FMFs) which have similar geometric parameters are fabricated. A VBC using a single-mode fiber and a passive FMF is designed and fabricated. The VBC can generate the first-order OAM in the range of 1480-1640 nm and its purity up to 91%. Then an all-fiber vortex amplification system is constructed for the first time and the first-order OAM is amplified using this system with a low-gain difference (ŒîG). The gain exceeds 22 dB at 1549 nm and its full width at half maximum is approximately 40 nm: 1519-1559 nm. This is a novel all-fiber OAM amplification system with a simple structure and low cost that is applicable in optical communication fields. ¬© 2009-2012 IEEE.;
Matrix-Vector vs. Matrix-Matrix Multiplication: Potential in DD-based Simulation of Quantum Computations;The simulation of quantum computations basically boils down to the multiplication of vectors (describing the respective quantum state) and matrices (describing the respective quantum operations). However since those matrices/vectors are exponential in size most of the existing solutions (relying on arrays for their representation) are either limited to rather small quantum systems or require substantial hardware resources. To overcome these shortcomings solutions based on decision diagrams (DD-based simulation) have been proposed recently. They exploit redundancies in quantum states as well as matrices and by this allow for a compact representation and manipulation. This offers further (unexpected) potential. In fact simulation has been conducted thus far by applying one operation (i.e. one matrix-vector multiplication) after another. Besides that there is the possibility to combine several operations (requiring a matrix-matrix multiplication) before applying them to a vector. But since from a theoretical perspective matrix-vector multiplication is significantly cheaper than matrix-matrix multiplication the potential of this direction was rather limited thus far. In this work we show that this changes when decision diagrams are employed. In fact their more compact representation frequently makes matrix-matrix multiplication more beneficial - leading to substantial improvements by exploiting the combination of operations. Experimental results confirm the proposed strategies for combining operations lead to speed-ups of several factors or - when additionally exploiting further knowledge about the considered instance - even of several orders of magnitudes. ¬© 2019 EDAA.;
Development Method of Building a Modular Simulator of Quantum Computations and Algorithms;The article assumes a description of the fundamentals of the theory of quantum computing in the field of quantum algorithms. A universal concept of a quantum algorithm is given and the time of operation of the algorithm with the determination of the probability of a particular result at the output is theoretically described. A method for constructing a modular simulator of quantum computations and algorithms its architecture and the interactions of its various components is considered. The paper developed a method for constructing a quantum algorithm for graph interpretation which is a study of the relationship between classical and quantum elements and concepts. An algorithm for graph interpretation and elimination (reduction) of graph vertices is built and a method of paralleling an undirected graph model by fixing the values of graph vertices is implemented. The advantage of this strategy is that all these assessments can be carried out in parallel. In this paper an assessment was made of the complexity of a particular algorithm based on the complexity function and a universal formula for calculating it was derived. The basics of developing quantum algorithms are described in accordance with specific software for implementing quantum algorithms and the stages of their development. Quantum algorithms involve the use of vector and matrix algebra. In accordance with this ‚Äúquantum‚Äù software is defined including: a quantum intermediate representation of information a quantum language of physical operations and a quantum assembler. ¬© Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.;
Correlation between geometric phase and concurrence of variable retarders of birefringent medium;The orbital angular momentum of photon is one of the key source of quantum information. Polarized light passing through twisted special wave plates show entangled states of both spin angular momentum (SAM) and orbital angular momentum (OAM). The variable circular and linear retarders (VCR and VLR) are studied here from the view point of quantum processing of entangled states. In association with twist dependent gain of OAM the geometric phase has been identified here both for VCR and VLR. For the application of VLR in an antenna array we established a correlation between geometric phase and concurrence to explain the gradual flattened shape of the emergent wave by controlling the external twist of wave plates. ¬© 2018 Elsevier GmbH;

A review of tunable orbital angular momentum modes in fiber: Principle and generation;Orbital angular momentum (OAM) beams a new fundamental degree of freedom have excited a great diversity of interest due to a variety of emerging applications. The scalability of OAM has always been a topic of discussion because it plays an important role in many applications such as expanding to large capacity and adjusting the trapped particle rotation speed. Thus the generation of arbitrary tunable OAM mode has been paid increasing attention. In this paper the basic concepts of classical OAM modes are introduced firstly. Then the tunable OAM modes are categorized into three types according to the orbital angular momentums and polarization states of mode carrying. In order to understand the OAM evolution of a mode intuitively three kinds of Poincar√© spheres (PSs) are introduced to represent the three kinds of tunable OAM modes. Numerous methods generating tunable OAM modes can be roughly divided into two types: spatial and fiber-based generation methods. The principles of fiber-based generation methods are interpreted by introducing two mode bases (linearly-polarized modes and vector modes) of the fiber. Finally the strengths and weaknesses of each generation method are pointed out and the key challenges for tunable OAM modes are discussed. ¬© 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI Basel Switzerland.;

Laguerre-gauss beams with polarization-OAM entanglement in a graded-index fiber;Spin-dependent effects on vortex light beams propagating in an inhomogeneous medium are demonstrated by solving the full three-component field Maxwell equations using the perturbation analysis. It is found that the hybrid Laguerre-Gauss modes with polarization-orbital angular momentum (OAM) entanglement are the vector solutions of the Maxwell equations in a graded-index medium. Focusing of linearly and circularly polarized vortex light beams in a cylindrical graded-index fiber is investigated. It is shown that the vortex light beam undergoes an additional transverse force acting differently on circular polarized beams with opposite handedness. The wave shape variation with distance taking into account the spin-orbit and nonparaxial effects is analyzed. Effect of long-term periodical revival of wave packets due to mode interference in a graded-index cylindrical optical fiber is demonstrated. ¬© COPYRIGHT SPIE.

Fibre based hyperentanglement generation for dense wavelength division multiplexing;Entanglement is a key resource in quantum information science and associated emerging technologies. Photonic systems offer a large range of exploitable entanglement degrees of freedom (DOF) such as frequency time polarization and spatial modes. Hyperentangled photons exploit multiple DOF simultaneously to enhance the performance of quantum information protocols. Here we report a fully guided-wave approach for generating polarization and energy-time hyperentangled photons at telecom wavelengths. Moreover by demultiplexing the broadband emission spectrum of the source into five standard telecom channel pairs we demonstrate compliance with fibre network standards and improve the effective bit rate capacity of the quantum channel up to one order of magnitude. In all channel pairs we observe a violation of a generalised Bell inequality by more than 27 standard deviations underlining the relevance of our approach. ¬© 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.;
Low frequency stable and accurate potential-based time domain integral equations for dielectric regions;Potential-based formulations are new approaches gaining interest for deriving computational electromagnetics methods that perform markedly better for low frequencies and complicated structures (e.g. subwavelength and multiscale geometries) compared to traditional field-based formulations. Further these methods are also more directly applicable to coupling into quantum physics problems that are becoming more prevalent in engineering applications. These methods derive their improved performance by developing systems to be discretized directly in terms of the magnetic vector potential and electric scalar potential which are deemed more fundamental quantities for quantum applications than the electric and magnetic fields. Performing derivations in this way has resulted in equations that can accurately capture both wave physics (where the electric and magnetic fields are tightly coupled) and quasistatic phenomena (where the electric and magnetic fields become increasingly uncoupled) at the same time. This work focuses on continuing the development of time domain integral equations (TDIEs) based on the potential-based formulation to meet the demanding bandwidth requirements needed to efficiently analyze a wide range of quantum electromagnetic physics. Past work on potential-based TDIEs were applicable to perfect electrically conducting objects and were shown to be stable and accurate over broad frequency ranges. More recently initial efforts at developing potential-based TDIEs for dielectric regions were introduced. However these initial equations did not exhibit the low frequency accuracy and stability properties desired from this formulation. This work demonstrates a new set of TDIEs that overcome the limitations of the original formulation achieving high accuracy and good stability at analyzing dielectric objects at very low frequencies. These properties of the improved formulation are demonstrated through numerical results. ¬© 2019 IEEE.;

Spectrally Resolved Photodynamics of Individual Emitters in Large-Area Monolayers of Hexagonal Boron Nitride;Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is a 2D wide band gap semiconductor that has recently been shown to display bright room-temperature emission in the visible region sparking immense interest in the material for use in quantum applications. In this work we study highly crystalline single atomic layers of chemical vapor deposition grown h-BN and find predominantly one type of emissive state. Using a multidimensional super-resolution fluorescence microscopy technique we simultaneously measure spatial position intensity and spectral properties of the emitters as they are exposed to continuous wave illumination over minutes. As well as low emitter heterogeneity we observe inhomogeneous broadening of emitter line-widths and power law dependency in fluorescence intermittency this is strikingly similar to previous work on quantum dots. These results show that high control over h-BN growth and treatment can produce a narrow distribution of emitter type and that surface interactions heavily influence the photodynamics. Furthermore we highlight the utility of spectrally resolved wide-field microscopy in the study of optically active excitations in atomically thin two-dimensional materials. ¬© 2019 American Chemical Society.;
High-dimensional quantum communication using space encoding;Quantum communication (QC) represents a key enabler for many quantum applications.

Automatic code generation from UML state chart diagrams;The fact that event driven systems can be modeled and implemented using unified modeling language (UML) state chart diagrams has led to the development of code generation tools. These are tremendously helpful in making software system designs and can even generate skeletal source code from these designs. The implementation of such automatic code generation from state diagrams is not fully supported by the existing programming languages. The major down side is that there is no one-to-one correspondence between the elements in the state chart diagram and the programming constructs. The existing programming elements cannot effectively implement two main components of the state diagram namely state hierarchy and concurrency. In this paper we present a novel design pattern for the implementation of the state diagram which includes hierarchical concurrent and history states. The state transitions of parallel states are delegated to the composite state class. The architecture of the code generator and the step by step process of code generation from UML state machine are proposed in the paper. The proposed approach is implemented and compared with similar tools and the results are found to be promising. ¬© 2013 IEEE.;

Fiber-based high-dimensional quantum communications;Quantum communication i.e. the ability to transport a quantum state from one place to another represents a crucial task for many quantum applications i.e. quantum cryptography quantum secret sharing and quantum networks. However current systems present main limitations in terms of low information rates short propagation distances and low compatibility with today classical optical infrastructure. These restrictions bound the development of this field and its practical applications. High-dimensional quantum communication can help in overcoming these challenges enhancing the information rate and the system error tolerance. We here report our recent results on high-dimensional fiber based quantum communication both with multicore and multimode fibers in which we prove the capability of preparing manipulating transmitting and measuring advanced quantum states with excellent fidelities. Our results pave the way towards high-dimensional quantum communication in an optical fiber infrastructure. ¬© 2019 SPIE.;
Methods for classically simulating noisy networked quantum architectures;As research on building scalable quantum computers advances it is important to be able to certify their correctness. Due to the exponential hardness of classically simulating quantum computation straight-forward verification through classical simulation fails. However we can classically simulate small scale quantum computations and hence we are able to test that devices behave as expected in this domain. This constitutes the first step towards obtaining confidence in the anticipated quantum-advantage when we extend to scales that can no longer be simulated. Realistic devices have restrictions due to their architecture and limitations due to physical imperfections and noise. Here we extend the usual ideal simulations by considering those effects. We provide a general methodology for constructing realistic simulations emulating the physical system which will both provide a benchmark for realistic devices and guide experimental research in the quest for quantum-advantage. We exemplify our methodology by simulating a networked architecture and corresponding noise-model in particular that of the device developed in the Networked Quantum Information Technologies Hub (NQIT) (Networked Quantum Information Technologies Hub 2018 https://nqit.ox.ac.uk/ 2016 private communication. The error model was based on communication with Chris Balance and Tom Harty mediated through Niel de Beaudrap early on the NQIT project. Continued collaboration and communication with experimentalists could lead in refinement of the error model which could be subject for future work.). For our simulations we use with suitable modification the classical simulator of Bravyi and Gosset 2016 (Phys. Rev. Lett. 116 250501). The specific problems considered belong to the class of instantaneous quantum polynomial-time (IQP) problems (Shepherd and Bremner 2009 Proc. R. Soc. A 465 141339) a class believed to be hard for classical computing devices and to be a promising candidate for the first demonstration of quantum-advantage. We first consider a subclass of IQP defined in Bermejo-Vega et al 2018 (Phys. Rev. X 8 021010) involving two-dimensional dynamical quantum simulators before moving to more general instances of IQP but which are still restricted to the architecture of NQIT. ¬© 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.;
Feasible computation based on quantum logic;The objective of this paper is to propose a feasible computational framework based on quantum logic. The usual quantum logic-based computational processes easily get stuck. The difficulty with the computation is ascribed to the difference in the inference rules for quantum and classical negations. It is shown that the new inference rule for negation which is akin to the classical one is partially applicable even to the quantum case. The resulting framework makes it possible to go beyond what the usual quantum logic-based computation could do. ¬© 2019 Springer Nature Switzerland AG.;
Is quantum computing becoming relevant to cyber-security?;In the past decade much has been done to explore the utility of quantum computing in the cybersphere including cryptography and machine learning.1‚Äì4 Despite the promising potential there has historically been a considerable degree of scepticism over how quickly the community would overcome the numerous obstacles involved in controlling and measuring quantum particles. In the past decade much has been done to explore the utility of quantum computing in the cybersphere including cryptography and machine learning. The way in which quantum operations can be applied to achieve new algorithms is not yet fully understood which means it's going to be an arms race. If you want to be ahead of the curve says Keegan Keplinger of eSentire you should learn quantum programming and find ways to implement the properties of superposition (that third bit state) in your everyday practice. ¬© 2018 Elsevier Ltd;
Quantum cryptography: A survey;This paper represents the overview of Quantum Cryptography. Cryptography is the art of secrecy and it is the use of quantum mechanical properties to perform cryptographic tasks. It is a way of securing the channel using quantum mechanics properties. There are so many examples of quantum cryptography but the most important example is Quantum Key Distribution which provides a solution to the breaking of various popular public key encryption and signature schemes (e.g. RSA and ElGamal). This helps to solve the security problems and also makes the communication channel is more secure. There are so many advantages of quantum cryptography one thing is that the quantum computer gives the quadratic speed up on the general problems and second thing is that the quantum cryptography lies in the fact it allows the completion of various cryptographic tasks. That is proven to be impossible using classical communication. ¬© 2019 Springer Nature Switzerland AG.;
Quantum computation in robotic science and applications;Using the effects of quantum mechanics for computing challenges has been an often discussed topic for decades.

Doping of two-dimensional semiconductors: A rapid review and outlook;Doping as a primary technique to modify semiconductor transport has achieved tremendous success in the past decades. For example boron and phosphorus doping of Si modulates the dominant carrier type between p-type and n-type serving as the backbone for the modern microelectronic technologies. Doped III-V semiconducting systems exhibit phenomenal optoelectronic properties. Magnesium doped gallium nitride plays an important role to build efficient blue light-emitting diode (LED) which won Nobel Prize in physics in 2014. The rise of two-dimensional (2D) materials sheds light on their potential in next generation electronic optoelectronic and quantum applications. These properties can further be controlled via doping of 2D materials however many challenges still remain in this field. Here we present a rapid review on the recent achievements and challenges in the metastable and substitutional doping of 2D materials followed by providing an outlook on integrating 2D materials into more advanced electronic architectures. ¬© Materials Research Society 2019.;
Quantitative robustness analysis of quantum programs;Quantum computation is a topic of significant recent interest with practical advances coming from both research and industry. A major challenge in quantum programming is dealing with errors (quantum noise) during execution. Because quantum resources (e.g. qubits) are scarce classical error correction techniques applied at the level of the architecture are currently cost-prohibitive. But while this reality means that quantum programs are almost certain to have errors there as yet exists no principled means to reason about erroneous behavior. This paper attempts to fill this gap by developing a semantics for erroneous quantum while programs as well as a logic for reasoning about them. This logic permits proving a property we have identified called œµ-robustness which characterizes possible ≈Çdistance≈æ between an ideal program and an erroneous one. We have proved the logic sound and showed its utility on several case studies notably: (1) analyzing the robustness of noisy versions of the quantum Bernoulli factory (QBF) and quantum walk (QW) (2) demonstrating the (in)effectiveness of different error correction schemes on single-qubit errors and (3) analyzing the robustness of a fault-tolerant version of QBF. ¬© 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).;
Qubit allocation as a combination of subgraph isomorphism and token swapping;"In 2016 the first quantum processors have been made available to the general public. The possibility of programming an actual quantum device has elicited much enthusiasm. Yet such possibility also brought challenges. One challenge is the so called Qubit Allocation problem: The mapping of a virtual quantum circuit into an actual quantum architecture. There exist solutions to this problem however in our opinion they fail to capitalize on decades of improvements on graph theory. In contrast this paper shows how to model qubit allocation as the combination of Subgraph Isomorphism and Token Swapping. This idea has been made possible by the publication of an approximative solution to the latter problem in 2016. We have compared our algorithm against five other qubit allocators all independently designed in the last two years including the winner of the IBM Challenge. When evaluated in ≈ÇTokyo a quantum architecture with 20 qubits our technique outperforms these state-of-the-art approaches in terms of the quality of the solutions that it finds and the amount of memory that it uses while showing practical runtime. ¬© 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

Complex-birefringent and chiral waveplates with metasurfaces;Metasurfaces composed of arrays of nano-resonators are a powerful tool for manipulation of polarization of light [1]. All-dielectric metasurfaces do not suffer absorption losses and are highly transparent in contrast to metallic structures and combined with recent advances in their design and fabrication have enabled efficient polarization manipulation and arbitrary phase shaping [2 3]. A new regime of complex-valued birefringence has been recently suggested [4] extending the notion of real-valued birefringence through the specially introduced polarization-sensitive loss or gain. This can enable fundamentally new possibilities for polarization control such as amplifying the angle between polarization vectors to improve detection sensitivity. However a practical realization of complex-valued birefringence concept was missing. In particular the theoretical approach in Ref. [4] was based on a complicated metamaterial with loss and gain which is challenging to fabricate and not suitable for quantum applications. ¬© 2019 IEEE;

An overview on quantum computing: The next generation in computing technology;Quantum computers have gained attention as the way forward in the advancement of computing speed and complexity. Quantum computer is the next generation of computers expected to overcome the limitations of today‚Äôs largest computers. Theory behind quantum computing has proved that it will outperform the conventional classical computers in practice. In this article the researchers x-ray the limitations of the classical computers that makes it no longer feasible to further advance its computational prowess. Studies was also carried out on the quantum phenomenon its principles features that gives it super computational prospects and a breakdown of its components. The researchers compared the quantum and classical computers and the state of research in both computers. Quantum computers show potential supremacy over supercomputers of today due to its superposition features that leads to quantum parallelism. When quantum is successfully built the classical computers may be rendered outdated. However reliability of a quantum computer remains a research focus and as it is still in the theoretical stage. ¬© International Research Publication House;
Mixed Linear and Non-linear Recursive Types;We describe a type system with mixed linear and non-linear recursive types called LNL-FPC (the linear/nonlinear fixpoint calculus). The type system supports linear typing which enhances the safety properties of programs but also supports non-linear typing as well which makes the type system more convenient for programming. Just like in FPC we show that LNL-FPC supports type-level recursion which in turn induces term-level recursion. We also provide sound and computationally adequate categorical models for LNL-FPC which describe the categorical structure of the substructural operations of Intuitionistic Linear Logic at all non-linear types including the recursive ones. In order to do so we describe a new technique for solving recursive domain equations within the category CPO by constructing the solutions over pre-embeddings. The type system also enjoys implicit weakening and contraction rules which we are able to model by identifying the canonical comonoid structure of all non-linear types. We also show that the requirements of our abstract model are reasonable by constructing a large class of concrete models that have found applications not only in classical functional programming but also in emerging programming paradigms that incorporate linear types such as quantum programming and circuit description programming languages. ¬© 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).;

Silicon qubit fidelities approaching incoherent noise limits via pulse engineering;Spin qubits created from gate-defined silicon metal‚Äìoxide‚Äìsemiconductor quantum dots are a promising architecture for quantum computation. The high single qubit fidelities possible in these systems combined with quantum error correcting codes could potentially offer a route to fault-tolerant quantum computing. To achieve fault tolerance however gate error rates must be reduced to below a certain threshold and in general correlated errors must be removed. Here we show that pulse engineering techniques can be used to reduce the average Clifford gate error rates for silicon quantum dot spin qubits down to 0.043%. This represents a factor of three improvement over state-of-the-art silicon quantum dot devices and extends the randomized benchmarking coherence time to 9.4 ms. By including tomographically complete measurements in our randomized benchmarking we infer a higher-order feature of the noise called the unitarity which measures the coherence of noise. This in turn allows us to theoretically predict that average gate error rates as low as 0.026% may be achievable with further pulse improvements. These spin qubit fidelities are ultimately limited by incoherent noise which we attribute to charge noise from the silicon device structure or the environment. ¬© 2019 The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.;
Quantum accelerated computer architectures;Modern computer applications usually consist of a variety of components that often require quite different computational co-processors. Some examples of such co-processors are TPUs GPUs or FPGAs. A more recent and promising technology that is being investigated is quantum co-processors. In this paper we present a modern computer architecture where a quantum co-processor is included as an additional accelerator. In such an environment the idea is to execute the application on a heterogeneous architecture where the classic processor will execute the host part but certain components will be mapped in our case on the quantum accelerator. To this purpose we define the distinct layers for the quantum computer architecture where there is a clear boundary between the host program and quantum kernel(s). We also discuss the opportunities and challenges of mapping hybrid algorithms to such a heterogeneous quantum computer architecture. ¬© 2019 IEEE;
Applications of single frequency blue lasers;Gallium nitride (GaN) sources are becoming a regular part of today's world and are now key devices for lighting infrastructures communications systems and quantum applications amongst others. In particular many applications have seen the shift from LEDs to laser diodes to make use of higher powers higher bandwidths and increased transmission distances. Laser communication systems are well established however there are applications where the ability to select a single emitted wavelength is highly desirable such as quantum atomic clocks or in filtered communication systems. Distributed feedback (DFB) lasers have been realised emitting at a single wavelength where the grating structure is etched into the sidewall of the ridge. The main motivation in developing these lasers is for the cooling of ions in atomic clocks however their feasibility for optical communications is also explored. Narrow linewidth lasers are desirable and this paper will explore how this is achieved. Data rates in excess of 1 Gbit/s have also been achieved in a directly modulated unfiltered system.

Quantum and classical communications on shared infrastructure;Future communications networks not only should enable massive exchange of classical bits but also the transmission of quantum bits on which many quantum applications rely. This will be the key to offering quantum technologies in a cost-efficient way and it should encompass the integration of quantum and classical networks at the core of existing optical communications networks as well as at the access end of such networks. In this work we cover a range of proposals that enable such an integration for one of the imminent applications of quantum technologies i.e. quantum key distribution (QKD) by which users can securely exchange a secret key for their cryptographic needs. This will include using wavelength division multiplexing techniques to send quantum and classical data on the same fiber as well as wireless access for QKD users to passive optical networks. In each case we explore optimal arrangements to find the best way forward for an amicable coexistence. ¬© 2019 IEEE.;
Review on Quantum Computing Tools and Algorithms;Computer performance improvement is one of the biggest challenges. The technology has moved towards increasing the performance by using Quantum computing which improves 20 times to decrypt the code compared to the classical computer. Quantum computing is computing which uses quantum mechanical phenomena. The main purpose of the quantum computing is to find algorithms which are considerably faster than the classical algorithms for solving the same problem. In this paper we are proposing the tools of quantum computing and different quantum algorithms. These ideas are first applied to classical computer and then to the quantum computer. We are also focusing on the architecture of quantum computing which is existing in literature. ¬© 2020 Springer Nature Switzerland AG.;
Perspectives on deterministic control of quantum point defects by scanned probes;Control over individual point defects in solid-state systems is becoming increasingly important not only for current semiconductor industries but also for next generation quantum information science and technologies. To realize the potential of these defects for scalable and high-performance quantum applications precise placement of defects and defect clusters at the nanoscale is required along with improved control over the nanoscale local environment to minimize decoherence. These requirements are met using scanned probe microscopy in silicon and III-V semiconductors which suggests the extension to hosts for quantum point defects such as diamond silicon carbide and hexagonal boron nitride is feasible. Here we provide a perspective on the principal challenges toward this end and new opportunities afforded by the integration of scanned probes with optical and magnetic resonance techniques. ¬© 2019 Jay A.

Generation of an optical vortex array in the course of acousto-optic diffraction;Generation of an array of optical vortices (OVs) with fractional charges under the condition of acousto-optic Bragg diffraction is revealed experimentally. The OVs emerge in a wide diffracted optical beam due to reflection from a thick acousto-optic grating that contains bifurcated fringes of acoustic waves (AWs). Changes in the AW frequency lead to deflection of the wide optical beam containing the OV array. The OVs preserve their spatial positions only in the narrow AW frequency range while larger changes in the frequency impose their movement out from the beam aperture with appearance of the other OVs in the other places of the beam cross section. ¬© 2018 Optical Society of America.;
Highly efficient ultra-broadband entangled photon-pair generation using a chirped PPSLT ridge waveguide;As some of the most promising quantum applications such as high resolution quantum optical coherence tomography (QOCT) [1] with dispersion cancellation as well as quantum key distribution require frequency entanglement. Therefore frequency entanglement light sources are an essential importance for implement of many quantum optical applications. So Far the most prominent method used for the entangled photon pair generation is spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) in nonlinear crystals. Recently with adopting chirp quasi-phase matching (QPM) PPSLT (periodically poled stoichiometric lithium tantalate) has been used as source of entangled photons with large bandwidth [2]. However improving the overall system efficiency is still remain challenging. ¬© 2019 IEEE;
All-in-fiber method of generating orbital angular momentum with helically symmetric fibers;An all-in-fiber method of generating orbital angular momentum (OAM) is proposed. A simple device composed with a section of helically symmetric fiber and another section of regular fiber is designed to convert input light to optical vortices. Finite element method calculation of first- and second-order OAM generation based on the coordinates transformation technique is taken to show that the eigenmodes of the helically symmetric fiber structures carry orbital and spin angular momentum. Simulation using the self-developed beam propagation method algorithm is also performed to verify the orbital angular momentum generation and evaluate the performance of the OAM generator. ¬© 2018 Optical Society of America;
Hexagonal boron nitride: A review of the emerging material platform for single-photon sources and the spin-photon interface;Single-photon sources and their optical spin readout are at the core of applications in quantum communication quantum computation and quantum sensing. Their integration in photonic structures such as photonic crystals microdisks microring resonators and nanopillars is essential for their deployment in quantum technologies. While there are currently only two material platforms (diamond and silicon carbide) with proven single-photon emission from the visible to infrared a quantum spin-photon interface and ancilla qubits it is expected that other material platforms could emerge with similar characteristics in the near future. These two materials also naturally lead to monolithic integrated photonics as both are good photonic materials. While so far the verification of single-photon sources was based on discovery assignment and then assessment and control of their quantum properties for applications a better approach could be to identify applications and then search for the material that could address the requirements of the application in terms of quantum properties of the defects. This approach is quite difficult as it is based mostly on the reliability of modeling and predicting of color center properties in various materials and their experimental verification is challenging. In this paper we review some recent advances in an emerging material low-dimensional (2D 1D 0D) hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) which could lead to establishing such a platform. We highlight the recent achievements of the specific material for the expected applications in quantum technologies indicating complementary outstanding properties compared to the other 3D bulk materials. ¬© 2020 Castelletto et al.;
Engineering and application of quantum emitters in hexagonal boron nitride;Layered van der Waals materials are emerging as compelling two-dimensional platforms for nanophotonics polaritonics valleytronics and spintronics and have the potential to transform applications in sensing imaging and quantum information processing. Amongst these hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is known to host ultra-bright room temperature quantum emitters whose nature is yet to be fully understood. Here we present a summary of the recent advances in our group on controlling and engineering the quantum emission energies in hBN as well as demonstration of using these emitters for various quantum applications. First we show a CVD technique to grow hBN hosting high density of emitters with emission energies distributed over 20nm range. This is a milestone on continuing the hBN progress in quantum optics as uncontrollable emission wavelength hinders the potential development of hBN-based devices and applications. In addition we report our recent understanding of photophysical properties and level structure of hBN emitters. In this regard we show a new modality for super resolution imaging based on quantum emitters in hBN which is expandable to other systems. Our findings expand current understanding of quantum emitters in hBN and demonstrate the potential of hBN for the development of hybrid quantum nanophotonic and optoelectronic devices based on two-dimensional materials. ¬© 2019 SPIE.;
Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) 2D nanoscale devices for classical and quantum signal transduction;Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) crystals possess ultrawide electronic bandgap of 5.9 eV and excellent chemical and thermal stability. Nanometer-scale thin films and atomic layers derived from the layered bulk of h-BN crystals have been widely adopted for enabling new two-dimensional (2D) devices and systems thanks to its excellent dielectric optical mechanical and thermal properties. Lately h-BN thin layers have also emerged as an attractive material and device platform for nanoscale optics photonics and quantum engineering. In this proceedings paper we report on some of our studies and initial results toward developing integrated photonic circuitry based on this van der Waals (vdW) layered crystal. The first part summarizes our effort on the creation and optical characterization of defect-related quantum emission in exfoliated and dry-transferred h-BN flakes. Based on the statistics from our measurements and state-of-the-art knowledge in the field we have identified a group of emitters with emission wavelength around 710 nm exhibiting large Debye-Waller (DW) factor. We then describe optical waveguide and cavity designs at the wavelength range of interest with the aim of achieving high optical cooperativity. Combined with our studies in ultrathin h-BN crystalline nanomechanical resonators and phononic waveguides these new explorations in quantum emitters will help pave the way to facilitating h-BN photonic devices and integrated systems for both classical and quantum applications. ¬© 2019 SPIE.;
Contractive freedoms of ensembles and quantum channels for infinite-dimensional systems;In this paper we reveal that the unitary freedom in ensemble of pure states with a given state and the unitary freedom in operator-sum representation for a given channel are no longer valid for infinite-dimensional systems.

Initial Potential-based Time Domain Surface Integral Equations for Dielectric Regions;The A-Œ¶ formulation has been proposed as a new paradigm for deriving computational electromagnetics methods with no low frequency breakdown and that are more directly applicable to coupling into quantum physics problems of interest. This formulation utilizes equations developed in terms of the magnetic vector potential (A) and electric scalar potential (Œ¶) which are deemed more fundamental quantities for quantum applications than the electric and magnetic fields. Further computational electromagnetics solvers developed from the A-Œ¶formulation have been successful at overcoming many of the inherent multiscale limitations that exist for field-based solvers. This has been shown in recent work where time domain integral equations (TDIEs) applicable to perfect electric conductor (PEC) objects were shown to be stable and accurate over broad frequency ranges. However many quantum electromagnetics applications of interest are pursued at optical frequencies where approximating metals as PEC is no longer acceptable. Instead these regions are more appropriately described with a Drude-Lorentz-Sommerfeld model and so computational electromagnetics solvers applicable to multiscale geometries that can analyze these regions over very broad frequency ranges are needed. This current work begins to address this need by presenting for the first time in either frequency or time domain a set of A-Œ¶ formulation surface integral equations applicable to simple loss-free dielectric regions. To do this we derive TDIEs based on recently developed integral representation of solutions to the wave equations for A and Œ¶. A rigorous functional framework that was used to analyze the stability of the PEC A-Œ¶ formulation TDIEs is leveraged to determine appropriate combinations of integral equations and unknowns so that stable marching-on-in-time discretization approaches for the dielectric TDIEs can be developed here. The result is a set of A-Œ¶ formulation TDIEs with appropriate discretization guidelines that can accurately and stably analyze dielectric regions at middle frequencies. Although not applicable at very low frequencies these equations provide an essential step toward this goal by determining a baseline for combinations of equations and unknowns for dielectric regions within this formulation. ¬© 2019 IEEE.;

String of data comparison through Laguerre-Gaussian modes;This work based on classical light was in uenced by quantum applications where comparison of quantum states is an important issue. Laguerre-Gaussian modes were used to encode and compare two independent signals. Polarization controlled SWAP gate exchanges information between two strings of data therefore preventing them from the leakage. Comparison is done with kHz frequency achieved by the Digital Micromirror Device. Detected power being a single value represents an overlap of both signals. Presented system is capable to perform direct error analysis together with a normalization procedure which overcomes the necessity of data post-processing and largely reduces time required for such comparison. We present a calibration procedure which uses the glass sample to determine the performance of the experimental setup.  ¬© 2020 SPIE.;

The properties of NV centers generated by implantation close to the surface are compared with bulk properties. ¬© 2020 Elsevier Inc.;
Manipulating valley-sensitive light-matter states in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides;Control over the interactions between light and matter underlies many classical and quantum applications. In recent years 2D layered semiconductors have gained prominence for optoelectronics because of their strong excitonic effects and capacity for van der Waals assembly. One of the unique features of these monolayer materials the valley pseudospin can be manipulated by controlling the local properties of optical fields. Here we discuss two manifestations of this optical control across different regimes of coupling. In a strongly coupled regime we discuss the dynamics of valley-polarized hybrid light-matter states or exciton-polaritons in a monolayer MoS2 embedded in a microcavity. Different dynamics of valley-polarized exciton-polaritons can be accessed with microcavity engineering by tuning system parameters such as cavity decay rate and exciton-photon coupling strength. Comparison of predictions and measurements demonstrate the ability to intentionally modify exciton-polariton valley characteristics illustrating the microcavity as a tool for manipulating and engineering valley dynamics in 2D materials. In the weak coupling regime optical selection rules give rise to the valley-selective optical Stark shift. We discuss recent advances in probing this effect with improved sensitivity. Both of these complementary approaches show how the valley structure of monolayer materials yield interesting light-matter phenomena that allow tuning of optical properties. ¬© 2019 SPIE.;
Addressing Temporal Variations in Qubit Quality Metrics for Parameterized Quantum Circuits;The public access to noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers facilitated by IBM Rigetti D - Wave etc. has propelled the development of quantum applications that may offer quantum supremacy in the future large-scale quantum computers. Parameterized quantum circuits (P QC) have emerged as a major driver for the development of quantum routines that potentially improve the circuit's resilience to the noise. PQC's have been applied in both generative (e.g. generative adversarial network) and discriminative (e.g. quantum classifier) tasks in the field of quantum machine learning. PQC's have been also considered to realize high fidelity quantum gates with the available imperfect native gates of a target quantum hardware. Parameters of a P QC are determined through an iterative training process for a target noisy quantum hardware. However temporal variations in qubit quality metrics affect the performance of a P QC. Therefore the circuit that is trained without considering temporal variations exhibits poor fidelity over time. In this paper we present training methodologies for P QC in a completely classical environment that can improve the fidelity of the trained P QC on a target NISQ hardware by as much as 21.91%. ¬© 2019 IEEE.;
Control and Readout Software for Superconducting Quantum Computing;Being important parts of the superconducting quantum computer the high-speed arbitrary waveform generator (AWG) ultraprecision dc source and high-speed digitizer are used to manipulate the qubit. The complexity of an experimental setup increases rapidly as the number of qubits grows. Cumbersome instrument management distortion of signals and inefficiency of data transmission are gradually highlighted and become the bottlenecks in scaling up the number of qubits. In addition fault-tolerant quantum computing has real-time feedback requirements of qubit states. To deal with these challenges we propose an instrument management software design in this paper. The software maps the resources of separate instruments to a unified virtual instrument achieving the scalability of the instruments. The processing and correction of signals are deployed on a server which automatically corrects the distortion of the signals. By designing a multi-threaded mechanism for the AWG and a custom-defined data-link protocol for the digitizer the efficiency of the software meets the requirements of experiments. Cooperating with the AWG and digitizer the software provides the real-time feedback capability using an instruction compiler. Thus the software meets the requirements of superconducting quantum computing as demonstrated through its application to a 12-bit quantum experiment. ¬© 1963-2012 IEEE.;
Implementation of Shor‚Äôs quantum factoring algorithm using projectQ framework;Prime number factorization is a problem in computer science where the solution to that problem takes super-polynomial time classically. Shor‚Äôs quantum factoring algorithm is able to solve the problem in polynomial time by harnessing the power of quantum computing. The implementation of the quantum algorithm itself is not detailed by Shor in his paper. In this paper an approach and experiment to implement Shor‚Äôs quantum factoring algorithm are proposed. The implementation is done using Python and a quantum computer simulator from ProjectQ. The testing and evaluation are completed in two computers with different hardware specifications. User time of the implementation is measured in comparison with other quantum computer simulators: ProjectQ and Quantum Computing Playground. This comparison was done to show the performance of Shor‚Äôs algorithm when simulated using different hardware. There is a 33% improvement in the execution time (user time) between the two computers with the accuracy of prime factorization in this implementation is inversely proportional to the number of qubits used. Further improvements upon the program that has been developed for this paper is its accuracy in terms of finding the factors of a number and the number of qubits used as previously mentioned. ¬© BEIESP.;

Progress in single-photon avalanche diode image sensors in standard CMOS: From two-dimensional monolithic to three-dimensional-stacked technology;Single-photon detection and photon counting are useful tools in many fields from light detection and ranging (LiDAR) to biomedical imaging and from time-resolved Raman spectroscopy to quantum applications. In this context recently single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) sensors in standard CMOS technology have been receiving considerable attention from both scientific and industrial communities since they can provide single-photon detection and photon-counting capabilities along with some functionalities such as time-of-arrival evaluation and histogram processing in a cost-effective manner. In this review we provide a comprehensive view of the CMOS SPAD technology: from fundamentals to cutting-edge technologies including three-dimensional (3D)-stacked CMOS SPAD sensors. ¬© 2018 The Japan Society of Applied Physics.;

An Efficient Methodology for Mapping Quantum Circuits to the IBM QX Architectures;In the past years quantum computers more and more have evolved from an academic idea to an upcoming reality. IBM's project IBM Q can be seen as evidence of this progress. Launched in March 2017 with the goal to provide access to quantum computers for a broad audience this allowed users to conduct quantum experiments on a 5-qubit and since June 2017 also on a 16-qubit quantum computer (called IBM QX2 and IBM QX3 respectively). Revised versions of these 5- and 16-qubit quantum computers (named IBM QX4 and IBM QX5 respectively) are available since September 2017. In order to use these the desired quantum functionality (e.g. provided in terms of a quantum circuit) has to be properly mapped so that the underlying physical constraints are satisfied - a complex task. This demands solutions to automatically and efficiently conduct this mapping process. In this paper we propose a methodology which addresses this problem i.e. maps the given quantum functionality to a realization which satisfies all constraints given by the architecture and at the same time keeps the overhead in terms of additionally required quantum gates minimal. The proposed methodology is generic can easily be configured for similar future architectures and is fully integrated into IBM's SDK. Experimental evaluations show that the proposed approach clearly outperforms IBM's own mapping solution. In fact for many quantum circuits the proposed approach determines a mapping to the IBM architecture within minutes while IBM's solution suffers from long runtimes and runs into a timeout of 1 h in several cases. As an additional benefit the proposed approach yields mapped circuits with smaller costs (i.e. fewer additional gates are required). All implementations of the proposed methodology are publicly available at http://iic.jku.at/eda/research/ibm-qx-mapping. ¬© 2018 IEEE.;
Optimised tapered amplifier systems for quantum technologies;Quantum 2.0 applications such as gravitational sensing require narrow linewidth lasers at specific wavelength and significant optical power. For single photon lidar applications such as to image through scattering media intense yet short optical pulses are required. These are requirements not readily provided by existing laser systems. We suggest the use of master oscillator power amplifier (MOPA) systems consisting of a seed source providing the required spectral and temporal optical characteristics combined with a semiconductor based tapered amplifier to amplify the seed power to levels adequate for the required quantum applications. Considerations of the construction of such systems are discussed. Furthermore there operational specifications will be determined and the suitability for quantum applications will be discussed. ¬© COPYRIGHT SPIE.

Advanced simulation of quantum computations;Quantum computation is a promising emerging technology which compared to conventional computation allows for substantial speed-ups e.g. for integer factorization or database search. However since physical realizations of quantum computers are in their infancy a significant amount of research in this domain still relies on simulations of quantum computations on conventional machines. This causes a significant complexity which current state-of-the-art simulators try to tackle with a rather straight forward array-based representation and by applying massive hardware power. There also exist solutions based on decision diagrams (i.e. graph-based approaches) that try to tackle the exponential complexity by exploiting redundancies in quantum states and operations. However these existing approaches do not fully exploit redundancies that are actually present. In this paper we revisit the basics of quantum computation investigate how corresponding quantum states and quantum operations can be represented even more compactly and eventually simulated in a more efficient fashion. This leads to a new graph-based simulation approach which outperforms state-of-the-art simulators (array-based as well as graph-based). Experimental evaluations show that the proposed solution is capable of simulating quantum computations for more qubits than before and in significantly less run-time (several magnitudes faster compared to previously proposed simulators). ¬© 1982-2012 IEEE.;

Improved DD-based Equivalence Checking of Quantum Circuits;Quantum computing is gaining considerable momentum through the recent progress in physical realizations of quantum computers. This led to rather sophisticated design flows in which the originally specified quantum functionality is compiled through different abstractions. This increasingly raises the question whether the respectively resulting quantum circuits indeed realize the originally intended function. Accordingly efficient methods for equivalence checking are gaining importance. However existing solutions still suffer from significant shortcomings such as their exponential worst case performance and an increased effort to obtain counterexamples in case of non-equivalence. In this work we propose an improved DD-based equivalence checking approach which addresses these shortcomings. To this end we utilize decision diagrams and exploit the fact that quantum operations are inherently reversible- A llowing for dedicated strategies that keep the overhead moderate in many cases. Experimental results confirm that the proposed strategies lead to substantial speed-ups- A llowing to perform equivalence checking of quantum circuits factors or even magnitudes faster than the state of the art. ¬© 2020 IEEE.;
Web-app realization of Shor's quantum factoring algorithm and Grover's quantum search algorithm;Quantum algorithms are well-known for their quadratic if not exponential speedup over their classical counterparts. The two widely-known quantum algorithms are Shor's quantum factoring algorithm and Grover's quantum search algorithm. Shor's quantum factoring algorithm could perform integer factorization in O(logN). Grover's quantum search algorithm could solve the unsorted search problem in O(‚àöN). However both algorithms are introduced as theoretical concepts in the original papers due to the limitations of quantum technology at that time. In this paper an improved way is presented to realize the two algorithms into a web application using state-of-the-art quantum technology. The web-app is designed and built considering the uses of a quantum simulator and libraries provided by ProjectQ and Rigetti Forest. The result shows that both algorithms are realizable into web-applications. ¬© 2019 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.;
Generation of orbital angular momentum modes using fiber systems;Orbital angular momentum (OAM) beams characterized by the helical phase wavefront have received significant interest in various areas of study. There are many methods to generate OAM beams which can be roughly divided into two types: spatial methods and fiber methods. As a natural shaper of OAM beams the fibers exhibit unique merits namely miniaturization and a low insertion loss. In this paper we review the recent advances in fiber OAM mode generation systems in both the interior and exterior of the beams. We introduce the basic concepts of fiber modes and the generation and detection theories of OAM modes. In addition fiber systems based on different nuclear devices are introduced including the long-period fiber grating the mode-selective coupler microstructural optical fiber and the photonic lantern. Finally the key challenges and prospects for fiber OAM mode systems are discussed. ¬© 2019 by the authors.;
Epitaxial growth and electronic properties of few-layer stanene on InSb (1 1 1);Stanene has been theoretically predicted to be a 2D topological insulator with a large band gap potentially hosting quantum spin Hall effect at room temperature. Here few-layer stanene films have been epitaxially grown on Sb-terminated InSb (1 1 1) surface and their structural and electrical properties are characterized. Scanning tunneling spectrum results reveal a large bulk bandgap in single-layer stanene (over 0.2 eV). Moreover spectroscopy evidence for a filled edge state near the steps was observed. The gap decreases dramatically with increasing number of layers and multilayer stanene should become a Dirac semimetal in the bulk limit. The changeover may involve nontrivial topological phase transitions. Clear and reproducible Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations were observed on the single-layer stanene films that were exposed to atmospheric conditions for an extended period of time showing the possibility for device experiments using nanofabrication and magneto-transport. Our results demonstrate that the single-layer stanene is a promising topological material for exploring fundamental physics and quantum applications. ¬© 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.;
Compiling SU(4) quantum circuits to IBM QX architectures;The Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) technology is currently investigated by major players in the field to build the first practically useful quantum computer. IBM QX architectures are the first ones which are already publicly available today. However in order to use them the respective quantum circuits have to be compiled for the respectively used target architecture. While first approaches have been proposed for this purpose they are infeasible for a certain set of SU(4) quantum circuits which have recently been introduced to benchmark corresponding compilers. In this work we analyze the bottlenecks of existing compilers and provide a dedicated method for compiling this kind of circuits to IBM QX architectures. Our experimental evaluation (using tools provided by IBM) shows that the proposed approach significantly outperforms IBM's own solution regarding fidelity of the compiled circuit as well as runtime. Moreover the solution proposed in this work has been declared winner of the IBM QISKit Developer Challenge.

High-Dimensional Quantum Communication: Benefits Progress and Future Challenges;In recent years there has been a rising interest in high-dimensional quantum states and their impact on quantum communication. Indeed the availability of an enlarged Hilbert space offers multiple advantages from larger information capacity and increased noise resilience to novel fundamental research possibilities in quantum physics. Multiple photonic degrees of freedom have been explored to generate high-dimensional quantum states both with bulk optics and integrated photonics. Furthermore these quantum states have been propagated through various channels for example free-space links single-mode multicore and multimode fibers and also aquatic channels experimentally demonstrating the theoretical advantages over 2D systems. Here the state-of-the-art on the generation propagation and detection of high-dimensional quantum states is reviewed. Quantum communication with states living in d-dimensional Hilbert spaces qudits yields great benefits. However qudits generation transmission and detection is not a simple task to accomplish.

Full abstraction for the quantum lambda-Calculus;Quantum programming languages permit a hardware independent high-level description of quantum algorithms. In particular the quantum Œ≥-calculus is a higher-order language with quantum primitives mixing quantum data and classical control. Giving satisfactory denotational semantics to the quantum Œ≥-calculus is a challenging problem that has attracted significant interest. In the past few years both static (the quantum relational model) and dynamic (quantum game semantics) denotational models were given with matching computational adequacy results. However no model was known to be fully abstract. Our first contribution is a full abstraction result for the games model of the quantum Œ≥-calculus. Full abstraction holds with respect to an observational quotient of strategies obtained by summing valuations of all states matching a given observable. Our proof method for full abstraction extends a technique recently introduced to prove full abstraction for probabilistic coherence spaces with respect to probabilistic PCF. Our second contribution is an interpretation-preserving functor from quantum games to the quantum relational model extending a long line of work on connecting static and dynamic denotational models. From this it follows that the quantum relational model is fully abstract as well. Altogether this gives a complete denotational landscape for the semantics of the quantum Œ≥-calculus with static and dynamic models related by a clean functorial correspondence and both fully abstract. ¬© 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).;
Efficiently embedding QUBO problems on adiabatic quantum computers;Adiabatic quantum computers like the D-Wave 2000Q can approximately solve the QUBO problem which is an NP-hard problem and have been shown to outperform classical computers on several instances. Solving the QUBO problem literally means solving virtually any NP-hard problem like the traveling salesman problem airline scheduling problem protein folding problem genotype imputation problem thereby enabling significant scientific progress and potentially saving millions/billions of dollars in logistics airlines healthcare and many other industries. However before QUBO problems are solved on quantum computers they must be embedded (or compiled) onto the hardware of quantum computers which in itself is a very hard problem. In this work we propose an efficient embedding algorithm that lets us embed QUBO problems fast uses less qubits and gets the objective function value close to the global minimum value. We then compare the performance of our embedding algorithm to that of D-Wave‚Äôs embedding algorithm which is the current state of the art and show that our embedding algorithm convincingly outperforms D-Wave‚Äôs embedding algorithm. Our embedding approach works with perfect Chimera graphs i.e. Chimera graphs with no missing qubits. ¬© 2019 Springer Science+Business Media LLC part of Springer Nature.;
Leveraging quantum annealing for large MIMO processing in centralized radio access networks;User demand for increasing amounts of wireless capacity continues to outpace supply and so to meet this demand significant progress has been made in new MIMO wireless physical layer techniques. Higher-performance systems now remain impractical largely only because their algorithms are extremely computationally demanding. For optimal performance an amount of computation that increases at an exponential rate both with the number of users and with the data rate of each user is often required. The base station's computational capacity is thus becoming one of the key limiting factors on wireless capacity. QuAMax is the first large MIMO centralized radio access network design to address this issue by leveraging quantum annealing on the problem. We have implemented QuAMax on the 2031 qubit D-Wave 2000Q quantum annealer the state-of-the-art in the field. Our experimental results evaluate that implementation on real and synthetic MIMO channel traces showing that 10 's of compute time on the 2000Q can enable 48 user 48 AP antenna BPSK communication at 20 dB SNR with a bit error rate of 10-6 and a 1500 byte frame error rate of 10-4. ¬© 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.;
Domain wall encoding of discrete variables for quantum annealing and QAOA;In this paper I propose a new method of encoding discrete variables into Ising model qubits for quantum optimisation. The new method is based on the physics of domain walls in one-dimensional Ising spin chains. I find that these encodings and the encoding of arbitrary two variable interactions is possible with only two body Ising terms Following on from similar results for the 'one hot' method of encoding discrete variables (Hadfield et al 2019 Algorithms 12 34) I also demonstrate that it is possible to construct two body mixer terms which do not leave the logical subspace an important consideration for optimising using the quantum alternating operator ansatz. I additionally discuss how since the couplings in the domain wall encoding only need to be ferromagnetic and therefore could in principle be much stronger than anti-ferromagnetic couplers application specific quantum annealers for discrete problems based on this construction may be beneficial. Finally I compare embedding for synthetic scheduling and colouring problems with the domain wall and one hot encodings on two graphs which are relevant for quantum annealing the chimera graph and the Pegasus graph. For every case I examine I find a similar or better performance from the domain wall encoding as compared to one hot but this advantage is highly dependent on the structure of the problem. For encoding some problems I find an advantage similar to the one found by embedding in a Pegasus graph compared to embedding in a chimera graph. ¬© 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.;
Cryptanalysis and improvement in controlled quantum dialogue using cluster states;The controlled quantum dialogue protocol which was put forward recently (Kao and Hwang in Quantum Inf Process 16(5):139 2017) is analyzed. It shows that a dishonest controller can successfully eavesdrop on the secret messages that the two users send by the different initial state attack or he (she) can disturb communication without being detected by the denial-of-service attack. To improve these security loopholes a new method to check eavesdropping is given. The correctness and efficiency of this method is proven. ¬© 2019 Springer Science+Business Media LLC part of Springer Nature.;
Quantum implementation of the Shor-code on multiple simulator platforms;Running general quantum algorithms on quantum computers is hard especially in the early stage of development of the quantum computer that we are in today. Many resources are required to transform a general problem to be run on a quantum computer for instance to satisfy the topology constraints of the quantum hardware. Furthermore quantum computers need to operate at temperatures close to absolute zero and hence resources are required to keep the quantum hardware at that level. Therefore simulating small instances of a quantum algorithm is often preferred over running it on actual quantum hardware. This is both cheaper and gives debugging capabilities which are unavailable on actual quantum hardware such as the evaluation of the full quantum state at intermediate points in the algorithm as well as at the end of the algorithm. By simulating small instances of quantum algorithms the quantum algorithm can be checked for errors and be debugged before implementing and running it on actual quantum hardware for larger instances. There are multiple initiatives to create quantum simulators and while looking alike there are difference among them. In this work we compare seven often used quantum simulators offered by various parties by implementing the Shor-code an error-correcting technique. The Shor-code can detect and correct all single qubit errors in a quantum circuit. For most multi-qubit errors correct detection and correction is not possible. We compare the seven quantum simulators on different aspects such as how easy it is to implement the Shor-code what its capabilities are regarding translation to actual quantum hardware and what the possibilities of simulating noise are. We also discuss aspects such as topology restrictions and the programming interface. ¬© 2019 SPIE.;
Theoretical framework for higher-order quantum theory;Higher-order quantum theory is an extension of quantum theory where one introduces transformations whose input and output are transformations thus generalizing the notion of channels and quantum operations. The generalization then goes recursively with the construction of a full hierarchy of maps of increasingly higher order. The analysis of special cases already showed that higher-order quantum functions exhibit features that cannot be tracked down to the usual circuits such as indefinite causal structures providing provable advantages over circuital maps. The present treatment provides a general framework where this kind of analysis can be carried out in full generality. The hierarchy of higher-order quantum maps is introduced axiomatically with a formulation based on the language of types of transformations. Complete positivity of higher-order maps is derived from the general admissibility conditions instead of being postulated as in previous approaches. The recursive characterization of convex sets of maps of a given type is used to prove equivalence relations between different types. The axioms of the framework do not refer to the specific mathematical structure of quantum theory and can therefore be exported in the context of any operational probabilistic theory. ¬© 2019 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

AutoQP: Genetic Programming for Quantum Programming;Quantum computing is a new era in the field of computation which makes use of quantum mechanical phenomena such as superposition entanglement and quantum annealing. It is a very promising field and has given a new paradigm to efficiently solve complex computational problems. However programming quantum computers is a difficult task. In this research we have developed a system called AutoQP which can write quantum computer code through genetic programming on a classical computer provided the input and expected output of a quantum program. We have tested AutoQP on two different quantum algorithms: Deutsch Problem and the Bernstein-Vazirani problem. In our experimental analysis AutoQP was able to generate quantum programs for solving both problems. The code generated by AutoQP was successfully tested on actual IBM quantum computers as well. It is expected that the proposed system can be very useful for the general development of quantum programs based on the IBM gate model. The source code for the proposed system is available at the URL: https://github.com/usamaahsan93/AutoQP. ¬© 2020 IEEE.;
Integration of OpenTap with quantum entanglement testbed for security analysis;OpenTap is a network traffic analysis tool tailored to remotely capture statistics from an Openflow switch. We have modified OpenTap for low latency packet capture of metadata which can be used for remote security analysis. We demonstrate the utility of this tool by capturing metadata from a quantum information testbed. Specifically the testbed transmits photon data to a desktop using packets which OpenTap captures. We used a servo motor to periodically block the beam to create 20ms dips in the photon intensity and then measured this intensity using two methods: via the metadata captured by OpenTap and via the photon timestamps gathered by the quantum information testbed. Every photon intensity dip detected by the quantum information testbed was also detected using just the metadata this indicates OpenTap can be used for remote real-time security analysis using packet metadata. ¬© 2019 SPIE.;
High-efficiency dual-frequency reflective linear polarization converter based on metasurface for microwave bands;A dual-broadband and high-efficiency reflective linear polarization converter based on an anisotropic metasurface is presented. The device consists of two symmetrical double-slotted metallic split-rings and one criss-cross structure a dielectric layer and a completely reflective metallic ground. The converter exhibits four resonances and can near-perfectly convert x- or y-polarized incident waves into cross-polarized waves in the frequency ranges of 9.38-13.36 GHz and 14.84-20.36 GHz. The polarization conversion ratios (PCRs) of the two bands are 98.21% and 99.32% respectively. The energy conversion ratio (ECR) for energy loss measurement is almost 100% in these frequency bands. The polarization conversion principle is studied. The bandwidths and PCRs of the two bands are determined by varying the dielectric layer thickness. The simulation results are consistent with experimental observations. The designed dual-broadband and high-efficiency metasurface has great potential in the application of electromagnetic polarization control. ¬© 2019 by the authors.;
Optimizing quantum programs against decoherence: Delaying qubits into quantum superposition;Quantum computing technology has reached a second renaissance in the last decade. However in the NISQ era pointed out by John Preskill in 2018 quantum noise and decoherence which affect the accuracy and execution effect of quantum programs cannot be ignored and corrected by the near future NISQ computers. In order to let users more easily write quantum programs the compiler and runtime system should consider underlying quantum hardware features such as decoherence. To address the challenges posed by decoherence in this paper we propose and prototype QLifeReducer to minimize the qubit lifetime in the input OpenQASM program by delaying qubits into quantum superposition. QLifeReducer includes three core modules i.e. the parser parallelism analyzer and transformer. It introduces the layered bundle format to express the quantum program where a set of parallelizable quantum operations is packaged into a bundle. We evaluate quantum programs before and after transformed by QLifeReducer on both real IBM Q 5 Tenerife and the self-developed simulator. The experimental results show that QLifeReducer reduces the error rate of a quantum program when executed on IBMQ 5 Tenerife by 11% and can reduce the longest qubit lifetime as well as average qubit lifetime by more than 20% on most quantum workloads. ¬© 2019 IEEE.;
High reflectance mirrors for micro-cavity applications;Cavity-based single photon emission possesses a very high potential for future quantum networks and quantum communication systems. Fabry-Perot cavities especially are a good candidate for these applications thanks to a circular mode profile emission and low-lasing threshold. These properties are related to the small volume of the active region and the use of highly reflective Distributed Bragg mirrors (DBRs). The reflectance of the DBRs is related to the finesse of the cavity. In order to assure a strong coupling in the cavity a high finesse is required and therefore a reflectivity value as high as 99.9999%. Achieving such a difficult goal faces many technical challenges and limiting parameters such as optical losses (scatter and absorption) and other limitations related to thin film coating technologies. The control of the mirror fabrication and losses will be addressed in this paper. ¬© 2019 SPIE.;
An Efficient Signature Scheme from Supersingular Elliptic Curve Isogenies;Since supersingular elliptic curve isogenies are one of the several candidate sources of hardness for building post-quantum cryptographic primitives the research of efficient signature schemes based on them is still a hot topic. In this paper we present a many-time signature scheme based on the hash function from supersingular elliptic curve isogenies over the finite field Fp2 where p=2521-1. Our signature scheme achieves smaller signature sizes relative to other post-quantum signature schemes based on supersingular elliptic curve isogenies such as Galbraith's signature schemes (AsiaCrypt 2017) and Yoo's scheme (FC 2017). The structure of our scheme follows that of the hash-based signature scheme submitted to National Institute of Standards and Technology for post-quantum cryptography in 2018 with some modifications. To complete the construction we firstly apply the method of Weil restriction to improve the efficiency of hash function from supersingular elliptic curve isogenies by approximately 30% then propose a new Winternitz one-time signature scheme based on the hash function. Finally we implement the signature scheme. ¬© 2013 IEEE.;
Modeling and control of a reconfigurable photonic circuit using deep learning;The complexity of experimental quantum information processing devices is increasing rapidly requiring new approaches to control them. In this paper we address the problems of practically modeling and controlling an integrated optical waveguide array chip- A technology expected to have many applications in telecommunications and optical quantum information processing. This photonic circuit can be electrically reconfigured but only the output optical signal can be monitored. As a result the conventional control methods cannot be naively applied. Characterizing such a chip is challenging for three reasons. First there are uncertainties associated with the Hamiltonian model describing the chip. Second we expect distortions of the control voltages caused by the chip's electrical response which cannot be directly observed. And third there are imperfections in the measurements caused by losses from coupling the chip externally to optical fibers. We have developed a deep neural network (NN) approach to solve these problems. The architecture is designed specifically to overcome the aforementioned challenges using a gated recurrent unit-based network as the central component. The Hamiltonian is estimated as a blackbox while the rules of quantum mechanics such as state evolution is embedded in the structure as a whitebox. The resulting overall graybox model of the chip shows good performance both quantitatively in terms of the mean square error and qualitatively in terms of the shape of the predicted waveforms We use this NN to solve a classical and a quantum control problem. In the classical application we find a control sequence to approximately realize a time-dependent output power distribution. For the quantum application we obtain the control voltages to realize a target set of quantum gates. The method we propose is generic and can be applied to other systems that can only be probed indirectly. ¬© 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.;
Air-core fiber distribution of hybrid vector vortex-polarization entangled states;Entanglement distribution between distant parties is one of the most important and challenging tasks in quantum communication. Distribution of photonic entangled states using optical fiber links is a fundamental building block toward quantum networks. Among the different degrees of freedom orbital angular momentum (OAM) is one of the most promising due to its natural capability to encode high dimensional quantum states. We experimentally demonstrate fiber distribution of hybrid polarization-vector vortex entangled photon pairs. To this end we exploit a recently developed air-core fiber that supports OAM modes. High fidelity distribution of the entangled states is demonstrated by performing quantum state tomography in the polarization-OAM Hilbert space after fiber propagation and by violations of Bell inequalities and multipartite entanglement tests. The results open new scenarios for quantum applications where correlated complex states can be transmitted by exploiting the vectorial nature of light.  ¬© The Authors.;
High purity twisted light from a metasurface solid state resonator;Twisted light carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) has given rise to many developments ranging from optical manipulation to optical communications. Generating twisted light from solid-state lasers was initially achieved by amplitude and dynamic phase control and more recently by manipulating the geometric phase of light. These lasers have been limited to generate superposition of OAM modes as well as scalar modes with OAM ‚Ñì = 10. Here we incorporate a metasurface device into a visible solid-state laser to control the angular momentum of light by arbitrary spin-to-orbit coupling. We demonstrate the generation of pure Laguerre Gaussian modes with OAM up to ‚Ñì = 100. Modal decomposition measurements of the output beams reveal the higher purity of the generated modes can reach up to 96% for ‚Ñì = 1 and 88% for ‚Ñì = 100. our approach offers a new route for high brightness OAM states at the source. ¬© 2020 SPIE.;
Color centers in diamond for quantum applications;Color centers in diamond can be devised in quantum applications. The most successful exemplary color center is the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond that has high spin ground state with favorable spin coherence time from cryogenic to room temperature that can be read out either optically or electrically. However the optical properties of NV center are not ideal for certain quantum applications. Therefore a search for alternative color centers with improved optical properties has been started in diamond. This paper briefly reviews recent experimental and theoretical results on the color centers alternative to NV center in diamond which are promising solid-state defect quantum bits for quantum communication and other applications. ¬© 2020 Elsevier Inc.;
Modulation of orbital angular momentum on the propagation dynamics of light fields;Optical vortices carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) have attracted extensive attention in recent decades because of their interesting applications in optical trapping optical machining optical communication quantum information and optical microscopy. Intriguing effects induced by OAMs such as angular momentum conversion spin Hall effect of light (SHEL) and spin‚Äìorbital interaction have also gained increasing interest. In this article we provide an overview of the modulations of OAMs on the propagation dynamics of scalar and vector fields in free space. First we introduce the evolution of canonical and noncanonical optical vortices and analyze the modulations by means of local spatial frequency. Second we review the Pancharatnam‚ÄìBerry (PB) phases arising from spin‚Äìorbital interaction and reveal the control of beam evolution referring to novel behavior such as spindependent splitting and polarization singularity conversion. Finally we discuss the propagation and focusing properties of azimuthally broken vector vortex beams. ¬© 2017 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.;

A Quantum-inspired optimization Heuristic for the Multiple Sequence Alignment Problem in Bio-computing;Data related to biology are characterized by large volume and requirements for enormous computational power. Biological sequences either of proteins or DNA/RNA segments can be large and usually need massive computations in order to discover relations and study particular properties. Aligning sequences is of great importance for various practical reasons. Multiple sequence alignment studies the problem of aligning several strings resulting in a complete alignment a problem for which several different approaches exist. In this work a novel heuristic method to progressively solve this problem is proposed using elements of quantum-inspired optimization. The proposed algorithm is described in detail and evaluated through simulations against other aligning methods. The experimental results seem promising for providing a good initial alignment especially for the case of large sets of sequences. ¬© 2019 IEEE.;
Semiconductor Quantum Dots for Integrated Quantum Photonics;Quantum mechanics promises to have a strong impact on many aspects of research and technology improving classical analogues via purely quantum effects. A large variety of tasks are currently under investigation for example the implementation of quantum computing sensing metrology and communication. From a general perspective in a similar way as classical computing benefited by the reduction of the device footprint enabling the realization of highly complex chips a range of quantum applications will sensibly improve thanks to the successful realization of on-chip quantum photonics. Conversely to bulky table-top experiments it would be very advantageous to transfer all required functionalities on the same quantum photonic chip. The key elements for quantum photonic circuits are on-demand nonclassical light sources a versatile photonic logic the ability to store quantum information and highly efficient detectors directly integrated on-chip. Among several systems capable of the efficient generation of single- and indistinguishable photons quantum dots are rapidly establishing as one of the most appealing candidates.

Polarization effects of light in an optical fiber;The spectrum of modes of cylindrical optical fiber is determined analytically by solving the three-component field Maxwell's equations using the perturbation analysis. The frequency shift of modes in a graded-index fiber due to nonparaxiality and polarization effects is demonstrated. The degeneracy lifting of modes with distinct orbital angular momentum (OAM) and polarization (spin) but the same total angular momentum due to the spin-orbit (vector) and tensor forces is shown. Generalized Stokes vectors consisting of nine real parameters in terms of irreducible spherical and Cartesian tensor operators are considered to describe the 3D electromagnetic field. Vector and tensor polarization degrees are proposed to characterize the polarized beam. ¬© 2020 SPIE. Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only.;
R&D advances for quantum communication systems;Understanding the nature of light leads to the question of how the principles of quantum physics can be harnessed in practical optical communication. A deeper understanding of fundamental physics has always advanced technology. However the quantum principles certainly have a distinctly limiting character when looked upon from the engineering point of view. A particle cannot have well-defined momentum and position at the same time. An informative measurement will unpredictably alter the state of a quantum object. One cannot reliably clone an arbitrary quantum state. These and a number of other similar principles give rise to what is commonly known as the quantum ‚Äúno-go theorems‚Äù-a disconcerting term when it comes to building something practical. And yet a search for novel principles of communication enabled by quantum physics began already in its early days and has only intensified since. On this path physicists are faced with a remarkable challenge: to turn a series of negative statements into new technological recipes. ¬© 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.;
Performance evaluation of impact of state machine transformation and run-time library on a C# application;State machines are important behavioral models used in Model-Driven Development (MDD) of software applications.

Identifying the minor set cover of dense connected bipartite graphs via random matching edge sets;Using quantum annealing to solve an optimization problem requires minor embedding a logic graph into a known hardware graph. In an effort to reduce the complexity of the minor embedding problem we introduce the minor set cover (MSC) of a known graph G: a subset of graph minors which contain any remaining minor of the graph as a subgraph. Any graph that can be embedded into G will be embeddable into a member of the MSC. Focusing on embedding into the hardware graph of commercially available quantum annealers we establish the MSC for a particular known virtual hardware which is a complete bipartite graph. We show that the complete bipartite graph KN                  N has a MSC of N minors from which KN         +         1 is identified as the largest clique minor of KN                  N. The case of determining the largest clique minor of hardware with faults is briefly discussed but remains an open question. ¬© 2017 Springer Science+Business Media New York.;
How to prove your calculus is decidable: Practical applications of second-Order algebraic theories and computation;We present a general methodology of proving the decidability of equational theory of programming language concepts in the framework of second-order algebraic theories.

Photonic spin Hall effect in metasurfaces: A brief review;The photonic spin Hall effect (SHE) originates from the interplay between the photon-spin (polarization) and the trajectory (extrinsic orbital angular momentum) of light i.e. the spin-orbit interaction. Metasurfaces metamaterials with a reduced dimensionality exhibit exceptional abilities for controlling the spin-orbit interaction and thereby manipulating the photonic SHE. Spin-redirection phase and Pancharatnam-Berry phase are the manifestations of spin-orbit interaction. The former is related to the evolution of the propagation direction and the latter to the manipulation with polarization state. Two distinct forms of splitting based on these two types of geometric phases can be induced by the photonic SHE in metasurfaces: the spin-dependent splitting in position space and in momentum space. The introduction of Pacharatnam-Berry phases through space-variant polarization manipulations with metasurfaces enables new approaches for fabricating the spin-Hall devices. Here we present a short review of photonic SHE in metasurfaces and outline the opportunities in spin photonics. ¬© 2016 Hailu Luo et al. published by De Gruyter.;

A survey on classical and quantum cryptography;‚ÄîConventionally every individual‚Äôs personal data is been digitalized but as the digital theft could arise from hackers residing anywhere in the world there is a need of huge improvement towards the security of an electronic data. Nowadays in order to make the existing security system more robust and secure the research work is abundantly increasing day by day. The extra data/information we share which is confidential greater is the risk of us falling to a data/information breach that is intentionally or unintentionally sharing of personal details to the unauthorized third parties. Now the hackers being intelligent and able to crack the currently available encryption methods hence the scope for building uncrackable codes is more.

A large-alphabet three-party quantum key distribution protocol based on orbital and spin angular momenta hybrid entanglement;The orthogonality of the orbital angular momentum (OAM) eigenstates enables a single photon carry an arbitrary number of bits. Moreover additional degrees of freedom (DOFs) of OAM can span a high-dimensional Hilbert space which could greatly increase information capacity and security. Moreover the use of the spin angular momentum‚ÄìOAM hybrid entangled state can increase Shannon dimensionality because photons can be hybrid entangled in multiple DOFs. Based on these observations we develop a hybrid entanglement quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol to achieve three-party quantum key distribution without classical message exchanges. In our proposed protocol a communicating party uses a spatial light modulator (SLM) and a specific phase hologram to modulate photons‚Äô OAM state. Similarly the other communicating parties use their SLMs and the fixed different phase holograms to modulate the OAM entangled photon pairs producing the shared key among the parties Alice Bob and Charlie without classical message exchanges. More importantly when the same operation is repeated for every party our protocol could be extended to a multiple-party QKD protocol. ¬© 2018 Springer Science+Business Media LLC part of Springer Nature.;
The network impact of hijacking a quantum repeater;In quantum networking repeater hijacking menaces the security and utility of quantum applications. To deal with this problem it is important to take a measure of the impact of quantum repeater hijacking. First we quantify the work of each quantum repeater with regards to each quantum communication. Based on this we show the costs for repeater hijacking detection using distributed quantum state tomography and the amount of work loss and rerouting penalties caused by hijacking. This quantitative evaluation covers both purification-entanglement swapping and quantum error correction repeater networks. Naive implementation of the checks necessary for correct network operation can be subverted by a single hijacker to bring down an entire network. Fortunately the simple fix of randomly assigned testing can prevent such an attack. ¬© 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd.;

The Quantum Car;"In this letter the use of quantum information as a security enabler for the future driverless vehicle is explored. Specifically the role combined classical and quantum information can have on the most important characteristic of the driverless vehicle paradigm-the vehicle location is investigated. By using information-theoretic verification frameworks coupled with emerging quantum-based location-verification procedures how vehicle positions can be authenticated with a probability of error simply not attainable in classical-only networks is shown. How other quantum applications can be seamlessly encapsulated within the same vehicular communication infrastructure required for location verification is also discussed. The two technology enablers required for the driverless quantum vehicle are an increase in current quantum memory timescales (likely) and wide-scale deployment of classical vehicular communication infrastructure (underway). It is argued that the enhanced safety features delivered by the quantum car"" mean its eventual deployment is inevitable. ¬© 2016 IEEE.""";
Demonstration of provably secure quantum key distribution (QKD);Optimized Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols revolutionize the cyber security by leveraging the quantum phenomenon for development of unbreakable security. Configurable quantum networks are necessary for accessible quantum applications amongst multiple users. Quantum key distribution is particularly interesting because of the many ways in which the key exchange can be carried out. Keys can be exchanged by encoding the key into a weak photon source using classical methods or the keys can be exchanged using pairs of photons entangled at the source or the keys can even be exchanged by encoding with classical hardware at the source with an entangling measurement which occurs at the photons destination. Each type of quantum key exchange has its own requirements that must be met for point-to-point implementations which makes it exceedingly difficult to implement multi-node quantum networks. We propose a programmable network model to time encoded quantum key distribution this version of QKD sends entangled photons to two users and the hardware is setup such that the relative time shift in the coincident photons encodes which measurement basis was used. The protocols were first simulated by modifying previous software which used the CHP quantum simulator and then a point-to-point key exchange was setup in hardware to demonstrate the time encoding aspects of the protocol. ¬© 2018 SPIE.;
Full-blind delegating private quantum computation;The delegating private quantum computation (DQC) protocol with the universal quantum gate set X Z H P R CNOT was firstly proposed by Broadbent et al. [Broadbent (2015)] and then Tan et al. [Tan and Zhou (2017)] tried to put forward a half-blind DQC protocol (HDQC) with another universal set H P CNOT T . However the decryption circuit of Toffoli gate (i.e. T) is a little redundant and Tan et al.‚Äôs protocol [Tan and Zhou (2017)] exists the information leak. In addition both of these two protocols just focus on the blindness of data (i.e. the client‚Äôs input and output) but do not consider the blindness of computation (i.e. the delegated quantum operation). For solving these problems we propose a full-blind DQC protocol (FDQC) with quantum gate set H P CNOT T where the desirable delegated quantum operation one of H P CNOT T is replaced by a fixed sequence (H P CZ CNOT T ) to make the computation blind and the decryption circuit of Toffoli gate is also optimized. Analysis shows that our protocol can not only correctly perform any delegated quantum computation but also holds the characteristics of data blindness and computation blindness.

Design of photonic microcavities in hexagonal boron nitride;We propose and design photonic crystal cavities (PCCs) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) for diverse photonic and quantum applications. Two dimensional (2D) hBN flakes contain quantum emitters which are ultra-bright and photostable at room temperature. To achieve optimal coupling of these emitters to optical resonators fabrication of cavities from hBN is therefore required to maximize the overlap between cavity optical modes and the emitters. Here we design 2D and 1D PCCs using anisotropic indices of hBN. The influence of underlying substrates and material absorption are investigated and spontaneous emission rate enhancements are calculated. Our results are promising for future quantum photonic experiments with hBN. ¬© 2018 Kim et al.;

Realization of the three-qubit quantum controlled gate based on matching Hermitian generators;This paper deals with the design of quantum unitary gate by matching the Hermitian generators. A given complicated quantum controlled gate is approximated by perturbing a simple quantum system with a small time-varying potential. The basic idea is to evaluate the generator HœÜ of the perturbed system approximately using first-order perturbation theory in the interaction picture. HœÜ depends on a modulating signal œÜ(t):0‚â§t‚â§T which modulates a known potential V. The generator HœÜ of the given gate Ug is evaluated using Hg= Œπlog Ug. The optimal modulating signal œÜ(t) is chosen so that ‚Äñ Hg- HœÜ‚Äñ is a minimum. The simple quantum system chosen for our simulation is harmonic oscillator with charge perturbed by an electric field that is a constant in space but time varying and is controlled externally. This is used to approximate the controlled unitary gate obtained by perturbing the oscillator with an anharmonic term proportional to q3. Simulations results show significantly small noise-to-signal ratio. Finally we discuss how the proposed method is particularly suitable for designing some commonly used unitary gates. Another example was chosen to illustrate this method of gate design is the ion-trap model. ¬© 2017 Springer Science+Business Media New York.;
Electro-optically induced topological reactions of optical indicatrix orientation and polarization state defects;We have studied the behavior of topological defects (TDs) of the optical indicatrix orientation and polarization state which appear when a divergent optical beam propagates through LiNbO3 crystals under an external electric field. We have found that the topological reaction of the splitting of a central TD of optical indicatrix orientation which occurs under the electric field E X  proceeds according to a scheme 1 1‚àï2 1‚àï2. This reaction splits a doubly charged optical vortex into two singly charged vortices. An increase in the electric field strength leads to angular displacement of the optical vortices thus making it possible to operate spatial positions of the optical vortices via a Pockels effect. We have found that the lateral TDs with the strengths ¬Ω represent the defects of the polarization state and are not caused by defects of optical indicatrix orientation. They form topological dipoles and generate optical vortices. These topological dipoles undergo no topological reactions in the external electric field. ¬© 2017 Optical Society of America.;

Coupling efficiencies of up to 68.5% within a numerical aperture of 0.34 are found. Further we show how Purcell factors up to 4.5 can be achieved for wavelength scale hemispheres coated with distributed Bragg reflectors. We conclude with an experimental proposal for the realisation of these structures. ¬© 2017 The Author(s).;
RWiN: New methodology for the development of reconfigurable WSN;This paper presents new challenges for the development of reconfigurable wireless sensor networks (RWSNs) that adapt dynamically their behaviors to their environment under different properties. An RWSN is a set of networked nodes that execute reconfigurable software tasks for the control of local sensors. We propose a new design methodology named RWiN of an RWSN using unified modeling language (UML) to analyze construct develop and verify easily RWSN architectures. For that we formulate a metamodel of RWSN based on UML to describe a zone-based architecture that uses a communication protocol for the optimization of distributed reconfigurations. To control the design complexity we model each agent of this architecture by nested state machines. To verify the temporal constraints by communicating agents each one is modeled by a timed automaton. The paper's contribution is applied to a case study which is simulated with TRMSim-WSN and UPPAAL environment to expose the originality of this new architecture. ¬© 2004-2012 IEEE.;
Energy linear momentum and angular momentum exchange between an electromagnetic wave-packet and a small particle;Invoking Maxwell's classical electrodynamics in conjunction with expressions for the electromagnetic (EM) energy momentum force and torque we use a few simple examples to demonstrate the nature of linear and angular momentum exchange between a wave-packet and a small spherical particle. The linear and angular momenta of the EM field when absorbed by the particle will be seen to elicit different responses from the particle. ¬© 2018 SPIE.;
A deterministic distributed algorithm for reasoning with connected row-convex constraints;The class of CRC constraints generalizes several tractable classes of constraints and is expressive enough to model problems in domains such as temporal reasoning geometric reasoning and scene labelling. This paper presents the first distributed deterministic algorithm for connected row-convex (CRC) constraints. Our distributed (partial) path consistency algorithm efficiently transforms a CRC constraint network into an equivalent constraint network where all constraints are minimal (i.e. they are the tightest constraints) and generating all solutions can be done in a backtrack- free manner. When compared with the state-of-ihe-Art distributed algorithm for CRC constraints which is a randomized one our algorithm guarantees to generate a solution for satisfiable CRC constraint networks and it is applicable to solve large networks in real distributed systems. The experimental evaluations show that our algorithm outperforms the statc-of-Thc-Art algorithm in both practice and theory. ¬© Copyright 2017 International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (www.ifaamas.org).

Analytical study on quantum computing and its initial role on big data;Quantum computers are computers which are based on quantum physics and lots of mathematical logic. In near future there is hope that these computers would allow us to reach quantum supremacy which means no classical supercomputer would be even close to performing computation solvable by the quantum computers. These quantum computers are now in their initial development stages. Although many kind of research about their quantum-based algorithms like quantum clustering Simon‚Äôs algorithm and applications like quantum cryptanalysis optimization problems have been theorized. Based on these researches we have discussed ways which quantum computing will have its impact on big data and simulation world. ¬© 2018 Institute of Advanced Scientific Research Inc.

Fully guided-wave photon pair source for quantum applications;We report a fully guided-wave source of polarisation entangled photons based on a periodically poled lithium niobate waveguide mounted in a Sagnac interferometer. We demonstrate the source's quality by converting polarisation entanglement to postselection-free energy-time entanglement for which we obtain a near-optimal S-parameter of 2.75 0.02 i.e. a violation of the Bell inequality by more than 35 standard deviations. The exclusive use of guided-wave components makes our source compact and stable which is a prerequisite for increasingly complex quantum applications. Additionally our source offers a great versatility in terms of photon pair emission spectrum and generated quantum state making it suitable for a broad range of quantum applications such as cryptography and metrology. In this sense we show how to use our source for chromatic dispersion measurements in optical fibres which opens new avenues in the field of quantum metrology. ¬© 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.;
Processing of cavities in SiC material for quantum technologies;Quantum technology is a field of significant interest that will benefit many applications including communications and sensing. SiC is a promising material for quantum applications such as quantum memories due to point defects specifically VSi in the material which result in long spin coherence times. We have found that no VSi are present in our epitaxially grown unintentionally and nitrogen-doped 4H-SiC with electron concentrations ranging from 1014 to 1018 cm-3. We create these vacancies using electron irradiation in concentrations from single defects to ensembles. To utilize the defect luminescence for realistic applications we have fabricated the SiC into photonic crystal arrays. We present the processing steps required to create photonic crystal cavities in SiC and subsequent challenges. ¬© 2018 Trans Tech Publications Switzerland.;
QX: A high-performance quantum computer simulation platform;Quantum computing is rapidly evolving especially after the discovery of several efficient quantum algorithms solving intractable classical problems such as Shor's factoring algorithm. However the realization of a large-scale physical quantum computer is very challenging and the number of qubits that are currently under development is still very low namely less than 15. In the absence of large size platforms quantum computer simulation is critical for developing and testing quantum algorithms and investigating the different challenges facing the design of quantum computer hardware. What makes quantum computer simulation on classical computers particularly challenging are the memory and computational resource requirements. In this paper we introduce a universal quantum computer simulator called QX that takes as input a specially designed quantum assembly language called QASM and provides through agressive optimisations high simulation speeds and large number of qubits. QX allows the simulation of up to 34 fully entangled qubits on a single node using less than 270 GB of memory. Our experiments using different quantum algorithms show that QX achieves significant simulation speedup over similar state-of-the-art simulation environment. ¬© 2017 IEEE.;
Characterizing the Nash equilibria of three-player Bayesian Quantum games;Quantum games with incomplete information can be studied within a Bayesian framework. We analyze games quantized within the EWL framework [Eisert Wilkens and Lewenstein Phys Rev. Lett. 83 3077 (1999)]. We solve for the Nash equilibria of a variety of two-player quantum games and compare the results to the solutions of the corresponding classical games. We then analyze Bayesian games where there is uncertainty about the player types in two-player conflicting interest games. The solutions to the Bayesian games are found to have a phase diagram-like structure where different equilibria exist in different parameter regions depending both on the amount of uncertainty and the degree of entanglement. We find that in games where a Pareto-optimal solution is not a Nash equilibrium it is possible for the quantized game to have an advantage over the classical version. In addition we analyze the behavior of the solutions as the strategy choices approach an unrestricted operation. We find that some games have a continuum of solutions bounded by the solutions of a simpler restricted game. A deeper understanding of Bayesian quantum game theory could lead to novel quantum applications in a multi-agent setting. ¬© 2017 SPIE.;
Resource-aware system architecture model for implementation of quantum aided Byzantine agreement on quantum repeater networks;                             Quantum aided Byzantine agreement is an important distributed quantum algorithm with unique features in comparison to classical deterministic and randomized algorithms requiring only a constant expected number of rounds in addition to giving a higher level of security. In this paper we analyze details of the high level multi-party algorithm and propose elements of the design for the quantum architecture and circuits required at each node to run the algorithm on a quantum repeater network (QRN). Our optimization techniques have reduced the quantum circuit depth by 44% and the number of qubits in each node by 20% for a minimum five-node setup compared to the design based on the standard arithmetic circuits. These improvements lead to a quantum system architecture with 160 qubits per node space-time product (an estimate of the required fidelity) KQ ‚âà 1.3 √ó 10                             5                              per node and error threshold 1.1 √ó 10                             -6                              for the total nodes in the network. The evaluation of the designed architecture shows that to execute the algorithm once on the minimum setup we need to successfully distribute a total of 648 Bell pairs across the network spread evenly between all pairs of nodes. This framework can be considered a starting point for establishing a road-map for light-weight demonstration of a distributed quantum application on QRNs.                          ¬© 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.;
Defects for quantum information processing in SiC;Crystal lattice defects in silicon carbide (SiC) have attracted attention for decades mainly due to their detrimental role in high-power and optoelectronic applications. Most recently spin-carrying defects in this technologically mature wide band gap semi-conductor were considered as very interesting for quantum applications being in many aspects similar to nitrogen vacancy centers in diamonds. However depending on the type of point defect in SiC they can have different spin-multiplicity in the ground and excited state namely triplet (S=1) or quadruplet (S=3/2). Accordingly several quantum sensing techniques can be developed and integrated in classical electronics and photonics e.g. all-optical magnetometry and thermometry which do not even require radio-frequency as well as single-photon emitters. We demonstrate how these defects can be created and engineered in a controlled way either by high energy or focused ion irradiation but also how they can be optically initialized and readout with pulsed ODMR technique in a broad range of temperatures including room temperature. Particularly intriguing for the future is to realize room-temperature quantum microwave amplifier with point defects in SiC. ¬© 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;
Multichannel Polarization-Controllable Superpositions of Orbital Angular Momentum States;An efficient approach to generate multiple orbital angular momentum (OAM) states and arbitrarily control their superpositions was reported. OAM states with different topological charges are realized in four separate channels using a single plasmonic metasurface consisting of space-variant arrays of gold nanoantennas without any additional optical elements. fabricate the designed metasurface a standard electron-beam lithography (EBL) and lift-off process were used. First the gold background layer (150 nm) and the SiO2 spacer (85 nm) were deposited onto a silicon substrate by using an electron beam evaporator. Then the positive polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) resist film was spin coated onto the SiO2 spacer layer and baked at 180 ¬∞C for 5 min. Then the nanostructures were defined on the PMMA film by EBL. Prior to gold deposition a titanium layer of 3 nm was deposited on the silicon dioxide (SiO2) layer for adhesion purposes. After that a 30 nm gold film was deposited on the sample via electron beam evaporation. Finally the metasurface structure was achieved by a subsequent lift-off procedure. Arbitrary manipulation of OAM superpositions in four channels is observed by controlling the polarization state of the incident light.;

Differential Privacy in Quantum Computation;More and more quantum algorithms have been designed for solving problems in machine learning database search and data analytics. An important problem then arises: how privacy can be protected when these algorithms are used on private data? For classical computing the notion of differential privacy provides a very useful conceptual framework in which a great number of mechanisms that protect privacy by introducing certain noises into algorithms have been successfully developed. This paper defines a notion of differential privacy for quantum information processing. We carefully examine how the mechanisms using three important types of quantum noise the amplitude/phase damping and depolarizing can protect differential privacy. A composition theorem is proved that enables us to combine multiple privacy-preserving operations in quantum information processing. ¬© 2017 IEEE.;
Optical storage of orbital angular momentum via Rydberg electromagnetically induced transparency;In this Letter we report on the successful optical storage of orbital angular momentum (OAM) using Rydberg electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in cold rubidium atoms. With a storage time of 1.4 Œºs the retrieved structure is highly similar showing the ability of storing light's OAM at a principal quantum number of 20. The results at higher principal quantum numbers (n=25 30) are also measured. These results show the promise of image processing based on a Rydberg atomic system. ¬© 2017 Chinese Optics Letters.;
Photokinetic analysis of the forces and torques exerted by optical tweezers carrying angular momentum;The theory of photokinetic effects expresses the forces and torques exerted by a beam of light in terms of experimentally accessible amplitude and phase profiles. We use this formalism to develop an intuitive explanation for the performance of optical tweezers operating in the Rayleigh regime including effects arising from the influence of light's angular momentum. First-order dipole contributions reveal how a focused beam can trap small objects and what features limit the trap's stability. The firstorder force separates naturally into a conservative intensity-gradient term that forms a trap and a non-conservative solenoidal term that drives the system out of thermodynamic equilibrium. Neither term depends on the light's polarization light's spin angular momentum plays no role at dipole order. Polarization-dependent effects such as trap-strength anisotropy and spin-curl forces are captured by the second-order dipole-interference contribution to the photokinetic force. The photokinetic expansion thus illuminates how light's angular momentum can be harnessed for optical micromanipulation even in the most basic optical traps. ¬© 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Software-defined network abstractions and configuration interfaces for building programmable quantum networks;Well-defined and stable quantum networks are essential to realize functional quantum communication applications. Quantum networks are complex and must use both quantum and classical channels to support quantum applications like QKD teleportation and superdense coding. In particular the no-cloning theorem prevents the reliable copying of quantum signals such that the quantum and classical channels must be highly coordinated using robust and extensible methods. In this paper we describe new network abstractions and interfaces for building programmable quantum networks. Our approach leverages new OpenFlow data structures and table type patterns to build programmable quantum networks and to support quantum applications. ¬© 2017 SPIE.;
The Entanglement Level and the Detection of Quantum Data Transfer Correctness in Short Qutrit Spin Chains;The quantum entanglement is an important feature of many protocols in the field of quantum computing. In this paper we evaluate a level of entanglement in short qutrit chains. This evaluation is carried out with use of the computable cross norm and realignment criterion and the concurrence measure. We also present some explicit formulae describing the concurrence measure for exemplary short spin chains. Utilizing the obtained results we indicate that analysing the level of entanglement allows to detect the noise or deviation in the transfer process in comparison to the perfect transfer where only operation realizing transfer is present. ¬© 2016 The Author(s).;
An approach for quantitatively analyzing the genuine tripartite nonlocality of general three-qubit states;Nonlocality is an important resource for quantum information processing. Genuine tripartite nonlocality which is sufficiently confirmed by the violation of Svetlichny inequality is a kind of more precious resource than the standard one. The genuine tripartite nonlocality is usually quantified by the amount of maximal violation of Svetlichny inequality. The problem of detecting and quantifying the genuine tripartite nonlocality of quantum states is of practical significance but still open for the case of general three-qubit quantum states. In this paper we quantitatively investigate the genuine nonlocality of three-qubit states which not only include pure states but also include mixed states. Firstly we derive a simplified formula for the genuine nonlocality of a general three-qubit state which is a function of the corresponding three correlation matrices. Secondly we develop three properties of the genuine nonlocality which can help us to analyze the genuine nonlocality of complex states and understand the nature of quantum nonlocality. Further we get analytical results of genuine nonlocality for two classes of three-qubit states which have special correlation matrices. In particular the genuine nonlocality of generalized three-qubit GHZ states which is derived by Ghose et al. (Phys. Rev. Lett. 102 250404 2009) and that of three-qubit GHZ-symmetric states which is derived by Paul et al.¬†(Phys. Rev. A 94 032101 2016) can be easily derived by applying the strategy and properties developed in this paper. ¬© 2018 Springer Science+Business Media LLC part of Springer Nature.;
Cryptanalysis and improvement of efficient quantum dialogue using entangled states and entanglement swapping without information leakage;The novel quantum dialogue (QD) protocol by using the three-dimensional Bell states and entanglement swapping (Wang et al. in Quantum Inf Process 15(6):2593‚Äì2603 2016) is analyzed. It is shown that there is the information leakage problem in this QD protocol. To be specific one quarter information of the secret messages exchanged is leaked out unconsciously. Afterward it is improved to a truly secure one without information leakage. Besides the security of the improved QD protocol is analyzed in detail. It is shown that the improved QD protocol has some obvious features compared with the original one. ¬© 2017 Springer Science+Business Media LLC.;
Bell state optimizations for reliable quantum applications;Well-defined and stable quantum networks are essential to realize functional quantum communication applications. In particular the quantum states must be precisely controlled to produce meaningful results. To counteract the unstable phase shifts in photonic systems we apply local Bell state measurements to calibrate a non-local quantum channel. The calibration procedure is tested by applying a time encoded quantum key distribution procedure using entangled photons. ¬© COPYRIGHT SPIE.

Design automation for quantum architectures;We survey recent strides made towards building a software framework that is capable of compiling quantum algorithms from a high-level description down to physical gates that can be implemented on a fault-tolerant quantum computer. We discuss why compilation and design automation tools such as the ones in our framework are key for tackling the grand challenge of building a scalable quantum computer. We then describe specialized libraries that have been developed using the LIQUi| programming language. This includes reversible circuits for arithmetic as well as new truly quantum approaches that rely on quantum computer architectures that allow the probabilistic execution of gates a model that can reduce time and space overheads in some cases. We highlight why these libraries are useful for the implementation of many quantum algorithms. Finally we survey the tool Revs that facilitate resource efficient compilation of higher-level irreversible programs into lower-level reversible circuits while trying to optimize the memory footprint of the resulting reversible networks. This is motivated by the limited availability of qubits for the foreseeable future. ¬© 2017 IEEE.;
Taking the quantum eraser to the abstract world;Youngs double slit experiment is one of the most celebrated achievements in quantum and classical optics it provides experimental proof of the wave-particle duality of light. When the paths of the double slit are marked with orthogonal polarizations the path information is revealed and no interference pattern is observed. However the path information can be erased with a complimentary analysis of the polarization. Here we use hybrid entanglement between photons carrying orbital angular momentum and polarization to show that just as in Young's experiment the paths (OAM) marked with polarization do not lead to interference. However when introducing the eraser (polarizer) which projects the polarization of one of the entangled photons onto a complementary polarization basis the OAM (paths) are allowed to interfere leading to the formation of azimuthal fringes whose frequency is proportional to the OAM content carried by the photon. ¬© 2017 SPIE.;

A hybrid quantum eraser scheme for characterization of free-space and fiber communication channels;We demonstrate a simple projective measurement based on the quantum eraser concept that can be used to characterize the disturbances of any communication channel. Quantum erasers are commonly implemented as spatially separated path interferometric schemes. Here we exploit the advantages of redefining the which-path information in terms of spatial modes replacing physical paths with abstract paths of orbital angular momentum (OAM). Remarkably vector modes (natural modes of free-space and fiber) have a non-separable feature of spin‚Äìorbit coupled states equivalent to the description of two independently marked paths. We explore the effects of fiber perturbations by probing a step-index optical fiber channel with a vector mode relevant to high-order spatial mode encoding of information for ultra-fast fiber communications. ¬© 2017 Elsevier B.V.;
The computer for the 21st century: Security & privacy challenges after 25 years;Decades went by since Mark Weiser published his influential work on how a computer of the 21st century would look like. Over the years some of the UbiComp features presented in that paper have been gradually adopted by industry players in the technology market. While this technological evolution resulted in many benefits to our society it has also posed along the way countless challenges that we have yet to surpass. In this paper we address major challenges from two areas that most afflict the UbiComp revolution: security and privacy. We examine open problems on software protection long-term security cryptography engineering and privacy implications. We also point out promising directions towards the solutions of those problems. We claim that if we get all this right we will turn the science fiction of UbiComp into science fact. ¬© 2017 IEEE.;
Optimizing adiabatic quantum program compilation using a graph-theoretic framework;Adiabatic quantum computing has evolved in recent years from a theoretical field into an immensely practical area a change partially sparked by D-Wave System‚Äôs quantum annealing hardware. These multimillion-dollar quantum annealers offer the potential to solve optimization problems millions of times faster than classical heuristics prompting researchers at Google NASA and Lockheed Martin to study how these computers can be applied to complex real-world problems such as NASA rover missions. Unfortunately compiling (embedding) an optimization problem into the annealing hardware is itself a difficult optimization problem and a major bottleneck currently preventing widespread adoption. Additionally while finding a single embedding is difficult no generalized method is known for tuning embeddings to use minimal hardware resources. To address these barriers we introduce a graph-theoretic framework for developing structured embedding algorithms. Using this framework we introduce a biclique virtual hardware layer to provide a simplified interface to the physical hardware. Additionally we exploit bipartite structure in quantum programs using odd cycle transversal (OCT) decompositions. By coupling an OCT-based embedding algorithm with new generalized reduction methods we develop a new baseline for embedding a wide range of optimization problems into fault-free D-Wave annealing hardware. To encourage the reuse and extension of these techniques we provide an implementation of the framework and embedding algorithms. ¬© 2018 Springer Science+Business Media LLC part of Springer Nature.;
One-way propagation of acoustic waves through a periodic structure;One-way acoustic transmission is achieved through a brass plate with a periodic grating on the surface. Using the Schlieren imaging technique the positive and negative propagation processes of acoustic waves through the periodic structure were experimentally observed. Simulations were performed using the finite-element method. Both the experimental and simulation results revealed a very large transmission ratio between positive and negative incidence thus demonstrating the feasibility of using this structure as an acoustic rectifier. The results indicate that the structure has a broadband working frequency. The structure has potential applications in ultrasonic medical devices and sonochemical reactors. ¬© 2018 The Japan Society of Applied Physics.;
Quantum-key distribution with vector modes;High-dimensional encoding using higher degrees of freedom has become topical in quantum communication protocols. When taking advantage of entanglement correlations the state space can be made even larger. Here we exploit the entanglement between two dimensional space and polarization qubits to realize a four-dimensional quantum key distribution protocol. This is achieved by using entangled states as a basis analogous to the Bell basis rather than typically encoding information on individual qubits. The encoding and decoding in the required complementary bases is achieved by manipulating the Pancharatnam-Berry phase with a single optical element: a q-plate. Our scheme shows a transmission fidelity of 0.98 and secret key rate of 0.9 bits per photon. While the use of only static elements is preferable we show that the low secret key rate is a consequence of the filter based detection of the modes rather than our choice of encoding modes. ¬© 2017 SPIE.;
Quantum light manipulation: A path towards efficient pure room-temperature single photon sources;Quantum light and in particular single photons have become essential resources for a growing number of quantum applications including quantum computing quantum key distribution and quantum metrology. Solid-state atomlike systems such as semiconductor quantum dots and color defects in crystals have become the hallmark of highly pure single photon emitters in the past two decades. A particular interest has been developed in nanocrystal quantum dots (NQDs) and color centers in diamond as potential compact room-temperature emitters. There are however several challenges that inhibit the use of such sources in current technologies including low photon extraction efficiency low emission rates and relatively low single photon purities. In this work we will review our efforts in overcoming these technical difficulties using several complementary methods including designing several nanoantenna devices that enhance the directionality and emission rate of the nanoemitter. In addition we developed several temporal heralding techniques to overcome the hurdle of low single photon purity in NQDs in an effort to produce a highly pure bright and efficient single photon source on-chip. ¬© 2018 SPIE.;
Limitations on post-processing assisted quantum programming;A quantum multimeter is a programmable device that can implement measurements of different observables depending on the programming quantum state inserted into it. The advantage of this arrangement over a single-purpose device is in its versatility: one can realize various measurements simply by changing the programming state. The classical manipulation of measurement output data is known as post-processing. In this work we study the post-processing assisted quantum programming which is a protocol where quantum programming and classical post-processing are combined. We provide examples showing that these two processes combined can be more efficient than either of them used separately. Furthermore we derive an inequality relating the programming resources to their corresponding programmed observables thereby enabling us to study the limitations on post-processing assisted quantum programming. ¬© 2017 Springer Science+Business Media New York.;
Lattice surgery on the Raussendorf lattice;Lattice surgery is a method to perform quantum computation fault-tolerantly by using operations on boundary qubits between different patches of the planar code. This technique allows for universal planar code computation without eliminating the intrinsic two-dimensional nearest-neighbor properties of the surface code that eases physical hardware implementations. Lattice surgery approaches to algorithmic compilation and optimization have been demonstrated to be more resource efficient for resource-intensive components of a fault-tolerant algorithm and consequently may be preferable over braid-based logic. Lattice surgery can be extended to the Raussendorf lattice providing a measurement-based approach to the surface code. In this paper we describe how lattice surgery can be performed on the Raussendorf lattice and therefore give a viable alternative to computation using braiding in measurement-based implementations of topological codes. ¬© 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd.;
Interaction of Structured Light with a Chiral Plasmonic Metasurface: Giant Enhancement of Chiro-Optic Response;We propose an approach to achieve giant enhancement and broad spectral tunability of the chiro-optic response of plasmonic metasurfaces by exploiting interaction with complex light endowed with both spin and orbital angular momentum. As a proof of principle we employ full-wave computational analysis to investigate the response of a structured circularly polarized transverse Laguerre-Gaussian beam incident on a chiral metasurface composed of a two-dimensional array of gold nanohelix meta-atoms. Our analysis reveals for the first time unprecedented amplification of circular dichroism that is a manifestation of the total angular momentum of the incident light being enantioselectively transferred to the medium. We also demonstrate that the spectral response of the meta-atoms can be designed to produce a rich manifold of narrow spectral lines with steep gradients. The approach proposed here opens up opportunities for new spectroscopic modalities to probe fundamental molecular structure and behavior as well as unique multiplexed biochemical sensing technologies and a new class of engineered chiral metamaterials in the form of versatile ultrathin media with unmatched optical performance for a gamut of applications including a new direction for spin photonics exploiting high reflection contrast between opposite spins. ¬© 2018 American Chemical Society.;
Recall Performance for Content-Addressable Memory Using Adiabatic Quantum Optimization;A content-addressable memory (CAM) stores key-value associations such that the key is recalled by providing its associated value. While CAM recall is traditionally performed using recurrent neural network models we show how to solve this problem using adiabatic quantum optimization. Our approach maps the recurrent neural network to a commercially available quantum processing unit by taking advantage of the common underlying Ising spin model. We then assess the accuracy of the quantum processor to store key-value associations by quantifying recall performance against an ensemble of problem sets. We observe that different learning rules from the neural network community influence recall accuracy but performance appears to be limited by potential noise in the processor. The strong connection established between quantum processors and neural network problems supports the growing intersection of these two ideas. ¬© 2017 by the authors.

Generation of the First-Order OAM Modes in Ring Fibers by Exerting Pressure Technology;We have proposed an effective method of generating the first-order orbital angular momentum (OAM) modes in ring fibers. The first-order OAM modes (L = ¬±1) can be represented as the linear superposition of the HEeven21 mode and the HEodd21 mode. Through exerting pressure on the ring fiber by a leverage device the fundamental mode HE11 can be coupled into higher order mode HE21 in broadband wavelength ranging from 1530 to 1600 nm. By adjusting the fiber polarization controller and the pressure value exerted on the fiber both the positive (L = +1) and negative (L = -1) OAM modes can be generated separately. Moreover we have demonstrated that the coupling efficiency from the fundamental mode to the first-order OAM modes at wavelength of 1550 nm can reach 67%. ¬© 2017 IEEE.;
Physics and application of persistent spin helix state in semiconductor heterostructures;In order to utilize the spin degree of freedom in semiconductors control of spin states and transfer of the spin information are fundamental requirements for future spintronic devices and quantum computing. Spin orbit (SO) interaction generates an effective magnetic field for moving electrons and enables spin generation spin manipulation and spin detection without using external magnetic field and magnetic materials. However spin relaxation also takes place due to a momentum dependent SO-induced effective magnetic field. As a result SO interaction is considered to be a double-edged sword facilitating spin control but preventing spin transport over long distances. The persistent spin helix (PSH) state solves this problem since uniaxial alignment of the SO field with SU(2) symmetry enables the suppression of spin relaxation while spin precession can still be controlled. Consequently understanding the PSH becomes an important step towards future spintronic technologies for classical and quantum applications. Here we review recent progress of PSH in semiconductor heterostructures and its device application. Fundamental physics of SO interaction and the conditions of a PSH state in semiconductor heterostructures are discussed. We introduce experimental techniques to observe a PSH and explain both optical and electrical measurements for detecting a long spin relaxation time and the formation of a helical spin texture. After emphasizing the bulk Dresselhaus SO coefficient Œ≥ the application of PSH states for spin transistors and logic circuits are discussed. ¬© 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.;
Proof-of-principle experiment of measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution with vector vortex beams;In this paper by combining measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD) scheme with entangled photon sources we present a modified MDI-QKD scheme with pairs of vector vortex(VV) beams which shows a structure of hybrid entangled entanglement corresponding to intrasystem entanglement and intersystem entanglement. The former entanglement which is entangled between polarization and orbit angular momentum within each VV beam is adopted to overcome the polarization misalignment associated with random rotations in quantum key distribution. The latter entanglement which is entangled between the two VV beams is used to perform entangled-based MDI-QKD protocol with pair of VV beams to inherit the merit of long distance. The numerical simulations show that our modified scheme can tolerate 97dB with practical detectors. Furthermore our modified protocol only needs to insert q-plates in practical experiment. ¬© 2018 SPIE.;
High-performance computing with quantum processing units;The prospects of quantum computing have driven efforts to realize fully functional quantum processing units (QPUs). Recent success in developing proof-of-principle QPUs has prompted the question of how to integrate these emerging processors into modern high-performance computing (HPC) systems. We examine how QPUs can be integrated into current and future HPC system architectures by accounting for functional and physical design requirements. We identify two integration pathways that are differentiated by infrastructure constraints on the QPU and the use cases expected for the HPC system. This includes a tight integration that assumes infrastructure bottlenecks can be overcome as well as a loose integration that assumes they cannot. We find that the performance of both approaches is likely to depend on the quantum interconnect that serves to entangle multiple QPUs. We also identify several challenges in assessing QPU performance for HPC and we consider new metrics that capture the interplay between system architecture and the quantum parallelism underlying computational performance. ¬© 2017 ACM.;
Automating quantum experiment control: From circuit compilation to ion routing;The field of quantum information processing is rapidly advancing. As the control of quantum systems approaches the level needed for useful computation the physical hardware underlying the quantum systems is becoming increasingly complex. It is already becoming impractical to manually code control for the larger hardware implementations. In this chapter we will employ an approach to the problem of system control that parallels compiler design for a classical computer. We will start with a candidate quantum computing technology the surface electrode ion trap and build a system instruction language which can be generated from a simple machine-independent programming language via compilation. We incorporate compile time generation of ion routing that separates the algorithm description from the physical geometry of the hardware. Extending this approach to automatic routing at run time allows for automated initialization of qubit number and placement and additionally allows for automated recovery after catastrophic events such as qubit loss. To show that these systems can handle real hardware we present a simple demonstration system that routes two ions around a multi-zone ion trap and handles ion loss and ion placement. While we will mainly use examples from transport-based ion trap quantum computing many of the issues and solutions are applicable to other architectures. ¬© 2017 Springer Science+Business Media New York.;

Algorithmic analysis of termination problems for quantum programs;We introduce the notion of linear ranking super-martingale (LRSM) for quantum programs (with nondeterministic choices namely angelic and demonic choices). Several termination theorems are established showing that the existence of the LRSMs of a quantum program implies its termination. Thus the termination problems of quantum programs is reduced to realisability and synthesis of LRSMs. We further show that the realisability and synthesis problem of LRSMs for quantum programs can be reduced to an SDP (Semi-Definite Programming) problem which can be settled with the existing SDP solvers. The techniques developed in this paper are used to analyse the termination of several example quantum programs including quantum random walks and quantum Bernoulli factory for random number generation. This work is essentially a generalisation of constraint-based approach to the corresponding problems for probabilistic programs developed in the recent literature by adding two novel ideas: (1) employing the fundamental Gleason's theorem in quantum mechanics to guide the choices of templates and (2) a generalised Farkas' lemma in terms of observables (Hermitian operators) in quantum physics. ¬© 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).;

A software methodology for compiling quantum programs;Quantum computers promise to transform our notions of computation by offering a completely new paradigm. To achieve scalable quantum computation optimizing compilers and a corresponding software design flow will be essential. We present a software architecture for compiling quantum programs from a high-level language program to hardware-specific instructions. We describe the necessary layers of abstraction and their differences and similarities to classical layers of a computer-aided design flow. For each layer of the stack we discuss the underlying methods for compilation and optimization. Our software methodology facilitates more rapid innovation among quantum algorithm designers quantum hardware engineers and experimentalists. It enables scalable compilation of complex quantum algorithms and can be targeted to any specific quantum hardware implementation. ¬© 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd.;
Test-driving 1000 qubits;Quantum computing is no longer a nascent field. Programmable quantum annealing (QA) devices with more than 1000 qubits are commercially available. How does one know that a putative QA device is indeed quantum? How should one go about benchmarking its performance and compare it to classical algorithms? How can its performance be improved by error correction? In this contribution to the focus collection on 'What would you do with 1000 qubits?' we review the work we and others have done in this area since the first D-Wave quantum annealer with 108 qubits was made available to us. Some of the lessons we have learned will be useful when other quantum computing platforms reach a similar scale and practitioners will attempt to demonstrate quantum speedup. ¬© 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd.;
Measurable cones and stable measurable functions: A model for probabilistic higher-order programming;We define a notion of stable and measurable map between cones endowed with measurability tests and show that it forms a cpo-enriched cartesian closed category.

We prove the soundness and adequacy of this model with respect to a call-by-name operational semantics and give some examples of its denotations. ¬© 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).;
A Novel Algorithm of Error Check and Code Generation for Structured Flowchart;Structured flowchart (SFC) and Automatic code generation based on SFC (CG-SFC) have been widely used in software requirements design and testing phases. Some CG-SFC tools such as Rhapsody have the ability to build flowchart and generate code but they do not check whether a given flowchart is correct or structural. For unstructured error 'goto' statements will be generated randomly. We proposed three algorithms and some error recognition criteria to solve those problems. Structure recognition algorithm can recognize Selection While/for and do-while structures. Error recognition algorithm incorporating criteria can check all the errors. At last we develop a CG-SFC system and compared with existing Rhapsody it shows that the proposed algorithms are correct and effective. ¬© 2017 Harbin Institute of Technology. All right reserved.;
On the completeness of the traced monoidal category axioms in (Rel+);It is shown that the traced monoidal category of finite sets and relations with coproduct as tensor is complete for the extension of the traced symmetric monoidal axioms by two simple axioms which capture the additive nature of trace in this category. The result is derived from a theorem saying that already the structure of finite partial injections as a traced monoidal category is complete for the given axioms. In practical terms this means that if two biaccessible flowchart schemes are not isomorphic then there exists an interpretation of the schemes by partial injections which distinguishes them.;
Electrically tunable generation of vectorial vortex beams with micro-patterned liquid crystal structures;We develop a new method for smooth and continuous space-variant alignment of the liquid crystal medium in micro-patterned structures which is based on a radial micro-structured pattern of polymeric ribbons exhibiting out-of-plane orientation with respect to the ITO-coated glass plates.

We also develop algorithms for synchronizing data delivery on classical and quantum channels. ¬© COPYRIGHT SPIE. Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only.;
A two-channel source of spectrally degenerate polarization entangled states on chip;In the last years the increasing complexity of quantum information protocols triggered the development of integrated waveguide technology for quantum applications [1-3] such that stability is intrinsically obtained thanks to the combination of many optical elements on a monolithic chip and scalability is potentially achievable. In this context the realization of integrated sources of quantum light is of fundamental interest. Some experimental implementations using parametric down conversion in nonlinear materials [4] as well as in semiconductors [5] have been reported. However in the landscape of integrated devices the realization of one important source of entangled states is still missing: a source of spectrally indistinguishable photon pairs emitted on two different spatial modes which share entanglement in the polarization degree of freedom without the need of post-selection. This source is widely adopted in bulk setups [6] indeed entanglement is a fundamental requirement for quantum information purposes and the polarization of photons is the most used degree of freedom for quantum information encoding. However the implementation of such a scheme in integrated waveguides is a challenging task due to the combination of orthogonal polarizations and the need of two different spatial modes. ¬© 2016 OSA.;
Auto-generating real-time capable robotics control software for highly reconfigurable robot platforms;This paper presents a novel implementation of the CASAH (Control Autonomy for Sampling and Handling) robotics software system used in research and technology development testbeds at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Our implementation divides control software into decoupled behavior user-interface and hardware-level bus modules. This decoupling at the module level is accomplished by auto-generating human-readable message types that are tailored to the exact hardware topology of whatever system is currently in use. These message types provide modules with a common framework for exchanging state information and relaying commands to devices while being agnostic to the communication protocol itself. We also detail how to structure behavior and bus modules to facilitate modularity and flexibility with third-party software. This software package has been used with success on multiple technology development testbeds at JPL an example of which is given in this paper and has proven to provide developers a lightweight and highly reconfigurable system for efficient debugging and practical code sharing. ¬© 2018 IEEE.;
Tunable interaction-free all-optical switching in a five-level atom-cavity system;A scheme is proposed for tunable all-optical switching based on the double-dark states in a five-level atom-cavity system. In the scheme the output signal light of the reflection and the transmission channels can be switched on or off by manipulating the control field. When the control light is coupled to the atom-cavity system the input signal light is reflected by the cavity. Thus there is no direct coupling between the control light and the signal light. Furthermore the position of the double-dark states can be changed by adjusting the coherent field and thus the switching in our scheme is tunable. By presenting the numerical calculations of the switching efficiency we show that this type of the interaction-free all-optical switching can be realized with high switching efficiency. ¬© 2017 Chinese Optics Letters.;
Generating tripartite nonlocality from bipartite resources;Nonlocality is an important resource for quantum information processing. Tripartite nonlocality is more difficult to produce in experiments than bipartite ones. In this paper we analyze a simple setting to generate tripartite nonlocality from two classes of bipartite resources namely two-qubit entangled pure states and Werner states. Upper bounds on the tripartite nonlocality characterized by the maximal violation of Svetlichny inequalities are given and the optimal measurements to achieve these bounds are provided. ¬© 2016 Springer Science+Business Media New York.;
Multichannel Metasurface for Simultaneous Control of Holograms and Twisted Light Beams;In terms of system integration and device miniaturization a single optical device that can possess more tunable functionalities in multiple channels is desirable. As a proof of concept we experimentally demonstrate such an ultrathin optical device that can simultaneously realize polarization-controllable hologram and superposition of orbital angular momentum (OAM) in multiple channels. By continuously controlling the polarization state of the incident light the polarization-dependent holographic images in two channels along the horizontal direction and the continuous control of OAM superposition in two channels along the vertical direction are realized. The uniqueness of the device lies in that both the superpositions of OAM states and the holographic images are controlled at the same time. This novel device provides a fast and efficient tool for simultaneous control of hologram and manipulation of OAM supposition in various channels which significantly simplifies the experimental system and is of importance for the current efforts in the field of information optics security quantum science and fundamental physics. ¬© 2017 American Chemical Society.;

Recent advances on optical vortex generation;This article reviews recent progress leading to the generation of optical vortex beams. After introducing the basics of optical vortex beams and their promising applications we summarized different approaches for optical vortex generation by discrete components and laser cavities. We place particular emphasis on the recent development of vortex generation by the planar phase plates which are able to engineer a spiral phasefront via dynamic or geometric phase in nanoscale and highlight the independent operation of these two different phases which leads to a multifunctional optical vortex beam generation and independent spin-orbit interaction. We also introduced the recent progress on vortex lasing including vortex beam generation from the output of bulk lasers by modification of conventional laser cavities with phase elements and from integrated on-chip microlasers. Similar approaches are also applied to generate fractional vortex beams carrying fractional topological charge. The advanced technology and approaches on design and nanofabrications enable multiple vortex beams generation from a single device via multiplexing multicasting and vortex array open up opportunities for applications on data processing information encoding/decoding communication and parallel data processing and micromanipulations. ¬© 2018 Xuewen Wang and Baohua Jia et al.

Coupling of lattice-Boltzmann solvers with suspended particles using the MPI intercommunication framework;The MPI intercommunication framework was used for coupling of two lattice-Boltzmann solvers with suspended particles which model advection and diffusion respectively of these particles in a carrier fluid. Simulation domain was divided into two parts one with advection and diffusion and the other with diffusion only (no macroscopic flow). Particles were exchanged between these domains at their common boundary by a direct process to process communication. By analysing weak and strong scaling it was shown that the linear scaling characteristics of the lattice-Boltzmann solvers were not compromised by their coupling. ¬© 2017 Elsevier Ltd;
Differential geometric treewidth estimation in adiabatic quantum computation;The D-Wave adiabatic quantum computing platform is designed to solve a particular class of problems‚Äîthe Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems. Due to the particular ‚ÄúChimera‚Äù physical architecture of the D-Wave chip the logical problem graph at hand needs an extra process called minor embedding in order to be solvable on the D-Wave architecture. The latter problem is itself NP-hard. In this paper we propose a novel polynomial-time approximation to the closely related treewidth based on the differential geometric concept of Ollivier‚ÄìRicci curvature. The latter runs in polynomial time and thus could significantly reduce the overall complexity of determining whether a QUBO problem is minor embeddable and thus solvable on the D-Wave architecture. ¬© 2016 Springer Science+Business Media New York.;
Optimizing Geometry Compression Using Quantum Annealing;The compression of geometry data is an important aspect of bandwidth-efficient data transfer for distributed 3d computer vision applications.

Key parts of the pipeline are mapped to NP-complete problems for which an efficient Ising formulation suitable for the execution on a Quantum Annealer exists. We describe existing Ising formulations for the maximum clique search problem and the smallest exact cover problem both of which are important building blocks of the proposed compression pipeline. Additionally we discuss the properties of the overall pipeline regarding result optimality and described Ising formulations. ¬© 2018 IEEE.;
Fundamental finite key limits for one-way information reconciliation in quantum key distribution;The security of quantum key distribution protocols is guaranteed by the laws of quantum mechanics. However a precise analysis of the security properties requires tools from both classical cryptography and information theory. Here we employ recent results in non-asymptotic classical information theory to show that one-way information reconciliation imposes fundamental limitations on the amount of secret key that can be extracted in the finite key regime. In particular we find that an often used approximation for the information leakage during information reconciliation is not generally valid. We propose an improved approximation that takes into account finite key effects and numerically test it against codes for two probability distributions that we call binary‚Äìbinary and binary‚ÄìGaussian that typically appear in quantum key distribution protocols. ¬© 2017 Springer Science+Business Media LLC.;
Efficient mapping of quantum circuits to the IBM QX architectures;In March 2017 IBM launched the project IBM Q with the goal to provide access to quantum computers for a broad audience. This allowed users to conduct quantum experiments on a 5-qubit and since June 2017 also on a 16-qubit quantum computer (called IBM QX2 and IBM QX3 respectively). In order to use these the desired quantum functionality (e.g. provided in terms of a quantum circuit) has to properly be mapped so that the underlying physical constraints are satisfied - a complex task. This demands for solutions to automatically and efficiently conduct this mapping process. In this paper we propose such an approach which satisfies all constraints given by the architecture and at the same time aims to keep the overhead in terms of additionally required quantum gates minimal. The proposed approach is generic and can easily be configured for future architectures. Experimental evaluations show that the proposed approach clearly outperforms IBM's own mapping solution with respect to runtime as well as resulting costs. ¬© 2018 EDAA.;
Concrete resource analysis of the quantum linear-system algorithm used to compute the electromagnetic scattering cross section of a 2D target;We provide a detailed estimate for the logical resource requirements of the quantum linear-system algorithm (Harrow et al. in Phys Rev Lett 103:150502 2009) including the recently described elaborations and application to computing the electromagnetic scattering cross section of a metallic target (Clader et al. in Phys Rev Lett 110:250504 2013). Our resource estimates are based on the standard quantum-circuit model of quantum computation they comprise circuit width (related to parallelism) circuit depth (total number of steps) the number of qubits and ancilla qubits employed and the overall number of elementary quantum gate operations as well as more specific gate counts for each elementary fault-tolerant gate from the standard set {XYZHSTCNOT;
Fault-tolerant high-level quantum circuits: Form compilation and description;Fault-tolerant quantum error correction is a necessity for any quantum architecture destined to tackle interesting large-scale problems. Its theoretical formalism has been well founded for nearly two decades. However we still do not have an appropriate compiler to produce a fault-tolerant error-corrected description from a higher-level quantum circuit for state-of the-art hardware models. There are many technical hurdles including dynamic circuit constructions that occur when constructing fault-tolerant circuits with commonly used error correcting codes. We introduce a package that converts high-level quantum circuits consisting of commonly used gates into a form employing all decompositions and ancillary protocols needed for fault-tolerant error correction. We call this form the (I)initialisation (C)NOT (M)measurement form (ICM) and consists of an initialisation layer of qubits into one of four distinct states a massive deterministic array of CNOT operations and a series of time-ordered X- or Z-basis measurements. The form allows a more flexible approach towards circuit optimisation. At the same time the package outputs a standard circuit or a canonical geometric description which is a necessity for operating current state-of-the-art hardware architectures using topological quantum codes. ¬© 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.;
Software system for the Mars 2020 mission sampling and caching testbeds;The development of the Sampling and Caching Subsystem (SCS) of the Mars 2020 Rover Mission is highly dependent on testing of prototype hardware and software operating in explicit conditions as part of integrated testbeds. To achieve relevant integration of hardware and software while maintaining rapid algorithm development capabilities and high testing throughput the Controls and Autonomy for Sample Acquisition and Handling (CASAH) software system was developed. CASAH is an implementation of the Intelligent Robotics System Architecture (IRSA) which mimics JPL Flight Software (FSW) in that it is divided into modules that run separate processes that communicate via message passing each module is assigned an owner that is a single developer and the operator initiates requests via a text-based interface that interprets sequences of commands. IRSA enables a modular breakdown of CASAH that follows that of 2020 Flight Software so developers can take an algorithm from a module in CASAH and re-code it into the same module in FSW. As deployment of CASAH has grown to ten testbeds - each with different hardware and objectives - bottom-up design decisions have been intentionally made to keep the system lightweight and maintainable by a very small team. To date CASAH has been used to run 1393 different tests. This work describes CASAH the testbeds and functionality it supports the tools used to manage the development and sharing of code and the features of the software. Lessons learned over the past three years of development and deployment are provided. ¬© 2018 IEEE.;
Programming quantum computers using design automation;Recent developments in quantum hardware indicate that systems featuring more than 50 physical qubits are within reach. At this scale classical simulation will no longer be feasible and there is a possibility that such quantum devices may outperform even classical supercomputers at certain tasks. With the rapid growth of qubit numbers and coherence times comes the increasingly difficult challenge of quantum program compilation. This entails the translation of a high-level description of a quantum algorithm to hardware-specific low-level operations which can be carried out by the quantum device. Some parts of the calculation may still be performed manually due to the lack of efficient methods. This in turn may lead to a design gap which will prevent the programming of a quantum computer. In this paper we discuss the challenges in fully-automatic quantum compilation. We motivate directions for future research to tackle these challenges. Yet with the algorithms and approaches that exist today we demonstrate how to automatically perform the quantum programming flow from algorithm to a physical quantum computer for a simple algorithmic benchmark namely the hidden shift problem. We present and use two tool flows which invoke RevKit.

The most important theoretical knowledge is summarized in the form of key points students should know about. Practical experience is presented in the area of deployment of SDN in data centers with aim on connecting the existing knowledge from traditional computer networks. This connection is explained on problems of traditional networks in data centers and mitigation of these problems by using SDN. Learned information is then extended by presenting a practical demo application in Mininet environment. The application shows possible usage of SDN for making a data center more power-efficient. This application is put in context by the theory of power consumption of data center devices which can be significantly reduced if SDN are used. Purpose of the application is to motivate students to continue in research of SDN area.;
A model-theoretic interpretation of environment-induced superselection;The question of what constitutes a system is foundational to quantum measurement theory. Environment-induced superselection or einselection has been proposed as an observer-independent mechanism by which apparently classical systems emerge from physical interactions between degrees of freedom described completely quantum mechanically. It is shown here that einselection can only generate classical systems if the environment is assumed a priori to be classical einselection therefore does not provide an observer-independent mechanism by which classicality can emerge from quantum dynamics. Einselection is then reformulated in terms of positive operator-valued measures acting on a global quantum state. It is shown that this reformulation enables a natural interpretation of apparently classical systems as virtual machines that requires no assumptions beyond those of classical computer science. ¬© 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group LLC.;
SyReC: A hardware description language for the specification and synthesis of reversible circuits;Although researchers and engineers originally focused on a preponderantly irreversible computing paradigm alternative models receive more and more attention. Reversible computation is a promising example which has applications in many emerging technologies such as quantum computation or alternative directions for low-power design. Accordingly the design of reversible circuits has become an intensely studied research area. In particular the efficient synthesis of complex reversible circuits poses an important and difficult research question. Most of the solutions proposed thus far are based on pure Boolean function representations such as truth tables or decision diagrams. In this paper we provide a comprehensive introduction to and present extensions for the hardware description language SyReC which allows for the specification and automatic synthesis of reversible circuits. Besides a detailed presentation of the language's concepts and operations we additionally propose algorithms that optimize the resulting circuits with respect to different objectives. A case study on a RISC CPU as well as a thorough experimental evaluation of both the synthesis approach and its optimizations show the applicability and demonstrate the advantage of SyReC compared to other solutions based on Boolean function representations. ¬© 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.;
Quantum key distribution without sharing reference frame using single photon rotational-invariant subspace;We report an experimental proposal of quantum key distribution without sharing reference frame by using single photon rotational-invariant subspace. The rotational-invariant subspace is achieved by taking advantage of photon's spin-orbital composite states.

A case study in programming a quantum annealer for hard operational planning problems;We report on a case study in programming an early quantum annealer to attack optimization problems related to operational planning. While a number of studies have looked at the performance of quantum annealers on problems native to their architecture and others have examined performance of select problems stemming from an application area ours is one of the first studies of a quantum annealer‚Äôs performance on parametrized families of hard problems from a practical domain. We explore two different general mappings of planning problems to quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems and apply them to two parametrized families of planning problems navigation-type and scheduling-type. We also examine two more compact but problem-type specific mappings to QUBO one for the navigation-type planning problems and one for the scheduling-type planning problems. We study embedding properties and parameter setting and examine their effect on the efficiency with which the quantum annealer solves these problems. From these results we derive insights useful for the programming and design of future quantum annealers: problem choice the mapping used the properties of the embedding and the annealing profile all matter each significantly affecting the performance. ¬© 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York (outside the USA).;

Quantum circuit physical design methodology with emphasis on physical synthesis;In our previous works we have introduced the concept of ‚Äúphysical synthesis‚Äù as a method to consider the mutual effects of quantum circuit synthesis and physical design. While physical synthesis can involve various techniques to improve the characteristics of the resulting quantum circuit we have proposed two techniques (namely gate exchanging and auxiliary qubit selection) to demonstrate the effectiveness of the physical synthesis. However the previous contributions focused mainly on the physical synthesis concept and the techniques were proposed only as a proof of concept. In this paper we propose a methodological framework for physical synthesis that involves all previously proposed techniques along with a newly introduced one (called auxiliary qubit insertion). We will show that the entire flow can be seen as one monolithic methodology. The proposed methodology is analyzed using a large set of benchmarks. Experimental results show that the proposed methodology decreases the average latency of quantum circuits by about 36.81¬†% for the attempted benchmarks. ¬© 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.;
Quantum walks: A comprehensive review;Quantum walks the quantum mechanical counterpart of classical random walks is an advanced tool for building quantum algorithms that has been recently shown to constitute a universal model of quantum computation.

Approximating markov processes by averaging;"Normally one thinks of probabilistic transition systems as taking an initial probability distribution over the state space into a new probability distribution representing the system after a transition. We however take a dual view of Markov processes as transformers of bounded measurable functions. This is very much in the same spirit as a predicate-transformer"" view which is dual to the state-transformer view of transition systems.We redevelop the theory of labelled Markov processes from this viewpoint in particular we explore approximation theory. We obtain three main results. (i) It is possible to define bisimulation on general measure spaces and show that it is an equivalence relation. The logical characterization of bisimulation can be done straightforwardly and generally. (ii) A new and flexible approach to approximation based on averaging can be given. This vastly generalizes and streamlines the idea of using conditional expectations to compute approximations. (iii) We show that there is a minimal process bisimulation-equivalent to a given process and this minimal process is obtained as the limit of the finite approximants. ¬© 2014 ACM.""";
Autonomous localization and acquisition of a sample tube for mars sample return;In this study a system was developed that is capable of autonomously detecting and manipulating a sample tube from a sandy surface. The robotic platform consists of a flightlike five degree-of-freedom arm that is currently employed in a Mars 2020 rover mission test bed. The software was based on the same flight-like code used for coring experiments in this test bed. The arm was retrofitted with an off-the-shelf parallel jaw gripper for tube manipulation. The jaws for the gripper were designed and fabricated to reject sand while providing robust axial and lateral grasping capabilities. A stereo camera pair was mounted at the arm base for localizing the sample tube. The end-to-end localization and acquisition process was performed using a red colored sample tube as well as a white tube coated in sand. Experimental results indicate that such a system could be feasible for a Mars Sample Return retrieval rover mission. ¬© 2015 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc AIAA.

Extraordinary optical transmission and vortex excitation by periodic arrays of Fresnel zone plates;Extraordinary optical transmission and good focusing properties of a two-dimensional scattering structure is presented. The structure is made of Fresnel zone plates periodically arranged along two orthogonal directions. Each plate consists of two ring-shaped waveguides supporting modes that match the symmetry of a circularly polarized incident plane wave. High field concentration at the focal plane is obtained with the short transverse and long longitudinal foci diameters. Optical vortex excitation in a paraxial region of the transmitted field is also observed and analysed in terms of cross-polarisation coupling. The structure presented may appear useful in visualization trapping and precise manipulations of nanoparticles.;
A quantum approach to diagnosis of multiple faults in electrical power systems;Diagnosing the minimal set of faults capable of explaining a set of given observations e.g. From sensor readouts is a hard combinatorial optimization problem usually tackled with artificial intelligence techniques. We present the mapping of this combinatorial problem to quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) and some preliminary experimental results of instances embedded onto the 509 qubit NASAGoogle-USRA quantum annealer. This is the first application with the route Problem > QUBO > Direct embedding into quantum hardware where we are able to implement and tackle problem instances with sizes that go beyond previously reported toy-model proof-of-principle implementations. We believe that these results represent a significant leap in the solution of problems via direct-embedding quantum optimization. ¬© 2014 IEEE.;
Production detection and manipulation of vortex beams and radially polarized beams;In this work we describe techniques for the generation of vortex beams including vortex generating diffraction gratings and diffractive lenses as well as some possible applications in optical image processing. We then analyze the description of radially polarized beams in terms of superposition of such vortex beams. We present some methods for the production of radially polarized light that include patterned linear polarizers specially designed liquid crystal devices and spatial light modulators (SLMs). We analyze the manipulation of this radial polarization by means of wave-plates in order to obtain other non-standard spatially variant polarized light beams. Theoretical analysis are presented based on the Jones matrix theory and experimental results are included for all cases.;
H-SRTF: A real-time framework supporting state machine model;The state machine can be used to describe reactive event-driven software system effectively. Existing commercial tools which can generate code from the state diagram all base on real-time framework mostly. But the code size of these frameworks is a little more it will be a big shortage for military weapon systems that the hardware resources are limited and time is critical. By the detailed analysis of mapping strategy from state diagram model to real-time framework a smart real-time framework is designed and implemented by C language.

Entanglement swapping with pure orbital angular momentum Bell-state analysis;We investigate a framework of an orbital angular momentum (OAM) entanglement swapping in a multi-dimensional Hilbert space with the spin angular momentum (SAM)-based orbital angular momentum (OAM) Bell-sate analysis. By the implementations of entanglement swapping with the SAM and OAM Bell-state measurements subsequently the OAM entanglement states (qudits) are generated and then transferred between photons in multi-dimensional Hilbert space in a point-to-point fashion. In the proposed scheme two pairs of the SAM-based OAM hybrid entanglement photons are deployed to conduct the successive SAM and OAM Bell-state measurements. It provides an alternative technique to transfer pure OAM Bell-states in qudits which illustrates a possible experimental approach for devising a full repeater in a complex quantum computation network where entanglement swapping serves as a critical constituent. ¬© 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We used a HC-PCF with the mode-field diameter compatible with standard single-mode fibers with the purpose of achieving low-loss splicing and enabling us to work at low pumping powers. This allows to induce a narrow transparency window which can be spectrally adjusted and dynamically controlled.;

The use of this active quantum walk is helpful to develop new quantum walk based searching and optimization algorithms. ¬© 2016 SPIE.;

Spin and orbital angular momentum of light and particle beams and their inter-conversion;The angular momentum of light can be split into spin and orbital components. Only recently several optical processes involving a conversion of angular momentum from one form to another were conceived and experimentally demonstrated. We will briefly review these processes and then survey some applications we have demonstrated of these spin-orbit effects in classical and quantum optics. Finally we will show that analogous spin-orbit effects can be conceived for electron beams leading to a theoretical proposal for a high-efficiency electron spin filter. If it will prove to be practical this device could lead to a spin-polarized electron microscopy. ¬© 2012 SPIE.;
Efficient synthesis of quantum circuits implementing clifford group operations;Quantum circuits established themselves as a promising emerging technology and hence attracted considerable attention in the domain of computer-aided design. As a result many approaches for synthesis of corresponding netlists have been proposed in the last decade. However as the design of quantum circuits faces serious obstacles caused by phenomena such as superposition entanglement and phase shifts automatic synthesis still represents a significant challenge. In this paper we propose an automatic synthesis approach for quantum circuits that implement Clifford Group operations. These circuits are essential for many quantum applications and cover core aspects of quantum functionality. The proposed approach exploits specific properties of the unitary transformation matrices that are associated to quantum operations. Furthermore Quantum Multiple-Valued Decision Diagrams (QMDDs) are employed for an efficient representation of these matrices. Experimental results confirm that this enables a compact realization of the respective quantum functionality. ¬© 2014 IEEE.;
Properties of vortex beams formed by an array of fibre lasers and their propagation in a turbulent atmosphere;Using a numerical simulation we investigate the possibility of synthesising vortex laser beams with a variable orbital angular momentum by a hexagonal array of fibre lasers under a phase control of individual subapertures of the array. We report the requirements to the parameters of the device generating a vortex beam (number and size of subapertures as well as their mutual arrangement). The propagation dynamics of synthesised vortex beams is compared with that of conventional Laguerre-Gaussian beams in free space and in a turbulent atmosphere. The spectral properties of the synthesised beam represented as a superposition of different azimuthal modes are determined during its propagation in free space. The energy and statistical parameters of the synthesised and Laguerre-Gaussian vortex beams are shown to coincide with increasing propagation distance in a turbulent medium. ¬© 2016 Kvantovaya Elektronika and Turpion Ltd.;
All-optical single resonance control using a silicon-based ringassisted mach-zehnder interferometer;CMOS-compatible ring-based active devices have attracted significant attention for their ability to confine and manipulate light on a compact SOI platform. Active modulation of a ring resonator is typically achieved by changing the intensity response. As an alternative to intensity modulation the phase modulation of the ring resonator can be converted into intensity modulation of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) by means of a ring-assisted Mach-Zehnder interferometer (RAMZI) structure. We theoretically demonstrate an all-optical single resonance switching using a silicon RAMZI by optically controlling the intracavity loss of the side-coupled silicon ring based on inverse Raman scattering (IRS). The RAMZI structure improves the modulation robustness against fabrication deviations by relaxing the coupling condition for the ring resonator without compensating the modulation performance. In silicon the IRS produces optical loss with a bandwidth of 105 GHz at the anti-Stokes wavelength which blueshifts 15.6 THz from the control light. For our proposed RAMZI structure the IRS induced loss is spectrally wider than the linewidth of the side-coupled ring but narrower than the free spectral range (FSR) of the ring guaranteeing single resonance selectivity. When the control light pulse of 200 ps switches from off (zero) to on (20pJ) the transmission of the anti-Stokes resonance transfers from 1.7% to 92.3%. The proposed structure provides the potential to multichannel all-optical routers on a CMOS compatible platform. ¬© 2013 SPIE.;

Our analysis supports the prospects of simultaneous acquisition of the state of polarization and 3D location of a point source with high-NA objectives. A second approach for doing joint polarimetry and localization using a specialized birefringent plate without the need for high-NA objectives is also discussed briefly. ¬© 2015 SPIE.;

Orbital Angular Momentum;Orbital angular momentum (OAM) has helped scientists think differently about light and has led to a number of discoveries both on the microscopic and macroscopic level. It has proven useful for applications in micromanipulation imaging and communication systems. One of the earliest methods of creating OAM-carrying beams is to use a pair of cylindrical lenses that transform a Hermite' Gaussian (HG) beam to a Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) beam. This kind of mode transformation was the method used by L. Allen et al. in 1992. OAM has been observed in several experiments and has even become a method of manipulating physical objects. One way of using the orbital OAM of light to manipulate particles was discovered through the development of optical tweezers. Spin angular momentum (SAM) and OAM are usually separable as they are typically independent when traveling through a transparent homogeneous medium with no spatially dependent optical properties. ¬© 2015 John Wiley & Sons Inc.;
A comparison of approaches for finding minimum identifying codes on graphs;In order to formulate mathematical conjectures likely to be true a number of base cases must be determined. However many combinatorial problems are NP-hard and the computational complexity makes this research approach difficult using a standard brute force approach on a typical computer. One sample problem explored is that of finding a minimum identifying code. To work around the computational issues a variety of methods are explored and consist of a parallel computing approach using MATLAB an adiabatic quantum optimization approach using a D-Wave quantum annealing processor and lastly using satisfiability modulo theory (SMT) and corresponding SMT solvers. Each of these methods requires the problem to be formulated in a unique manner. In this paper we address the challenges of computing solutions to this NP-hard problem with respect to each of these methods. ¬© 2016 Springer Science+Business Media New York (outside the USA).;
Efficient light storage with reduced energy loss via nonlinear compensation in rubidium vapor;We report an experimental demonstration of efficient light storage based on a modified technique of electromagnetically induced transparency in hot rubidium vapor. By introducing an auxiliary pump field to go beyond the Œõ-type configuration we find that the undesired four-wave mixing can be greatly suppressed to result in sufficiently reduced energy loss of a probe pulse. The light storage efficiency can be as high as ‚àº80% within the storage time of 100 ns with the pump field applied which is almost 6 times larger than that in the absence of the pump field. We may also amend the light storage efficiency in a linear way by increasing the optical depth of our atomic vapor even without saturation effect. We obtain in fact an amplified probe pulse via Raman gain during light storage and retrieval which should have practical applications in classical and quantum information processing. ¬© 2016 Astro Ltd.;
Realization of quantum gates based on three-dimensional harmonic oscillator in a time-varying electromagnetic field;This paper presents the design of a given quantum unitary gate by perturbing a three-dimensional (3-D) quantum harmonic oscillator with a time-varying but spatially constant electromagnetic field. The idea is based on expressing the radiation- perturbed Hamiltonian as the sum of the unperturbed Hamiltonian and O(e) and (Formula presented.)) perturbations and then solving the Schr√∂dinger equation to obtain the evolution operator at time T up to (Formula presented.)) and this is a linear-quadratic function of the perturbing electromagnetic field values over the time interval [0¬†T]. Setting the variational derivative of the error energy with respect to the electromagnetic field values with an average electromagnetic field energy constraint leads to the optimal electromagnetic field solution a linear integral equation. The reliability of such a gate design procedure in the presence of heat bath coupling is analysed and finally an example illustrating how atoms and molecules can be approximated using oscillators is presented. ¬© 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York.;
Vortex beam generation based on a fiber array combining and propagation through a turbulent atmosphere;We suggest a technique for generation of optical vortex beams with a variable orbital angular momentum based on a fiber laser array. The technique uses the phase control of each single subbeam. Requirements for the number of subbeams and the spatial arrangement for the vortex beam generation are determined. The propagation dynamics of a vortex beam synthesized is compared with that of a continuous Laguerre-Gaussian beam in free space and in a turbulent atmosphere. Spectral properties of a beam synthesized which is represented as a superposition of different azimuth modes are determined during its free-space propagation. It is shown that energy and statistical parameters coincide for synthesized and continuous vortex beams when propagating through a turbulent medium. Probability density functions of the beam intensity fluctuations are well approximated to a gamma distribution in the cases where the scintillation index is lower than unity independently of the beam type and observation point position relative to the propagation axis. ¬© 2016 SPIE.;
C-NOT three-gates performance by coherent cavity field and its optimized quantum applications;A new realization model of controlled-not (C-NOT) three gates operations between two atoms and coherent light. The proposed interaction model allows to earn more interaction time compared with the C-NOT two gates model of the reference work. As investigation of the obtained results we enhance and optimize a recent teleportation work via coherent cavity field by using less cavities number during the teleportation process. A higher probability have seen in the coherent state teleportation compared with the reference teleportation protocol (single photon teleportation). Furthermore a generation and teleportation scheme of multipartite GHZ-type entangled coherent states is established. We note that more efficiency is given to our scheme because of simplicity of homodyne detection for coherent light. ¬© 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.;
Limiting effects of geometrical and optical nonlinearities on the squeezing in optomechanics;In recent experiments the re-thermalization time of the mechanical resonator is stated as the limiting factor for quantum applications of optomechanical systems. To explain the origin of this limitation an analytical nonlinear investigation supported by the recent successful experimental laser cooling parameters is carried out in this work. To this end the effects of geometrical and the optical nonlinearities on the squeezing are studied and are in a good agreement with the experimental results. It appears that highly squeezed state are generated where these nonlinearities are minimized and that high nonlinearities are limiting factors to reach the quantum ground state. ¬© 2013 Elsevier B.V.;
QLib: Quantum module library;Quantum algorithms are known for their ability to solve some problems much faster than classical algorithms. They are executed on quantum circuits which consist of a cascade of quantum gates. However synthesis of quantum circuits is not straightforward because of the complexity of quantum algorithms. Generally quantum algorithms contain two parts: classical and quantum. Thus synthesizing circuits for the two parts separately reduces overall synthesis complexity. In addition many quantum algorithms use similar subroutines that can be implemented with similar circuit modules. Because of their frequent use it is important to use automated scripts to generate such modules efficiently. These modules can then be subjected to further synthesis optimizations. This article proposes QLib a quantum module library which contains scripts to generate quantum modules of different sizes and specifications for well-known quantum algorithms. Thus QLib can also serve as a suite of benchmarks for quantum logic and physical synthesis. ¬© 2014 ACM.;
PAQCS: Physical Design-Aware Fault-Tolerant Quantum Circuit Synthesis;Quantum circuits consist of a cascade of quantum gates. In a physical design-unaware quantum logic circuit a gate is assumed to operate on an arbitrary set of quantum bits (qubits) without considering the physical location of the qubits. However in reality physical qubits have to be placed on a grid. Each node of the grid represents a qubit. The grid implements the architecture of the quantum computer. A physical constraint often imposed is that quantum gates can only operate on adjacent qubits on the grid. Hence a communication channel needs to be built if the qubits in the logical circuit are not adjacent. In this paper we introduce a tool called the physical design-aware fault-tolerant quantum circuit synthesis (PAQCS). It contains two algorithms: one for physical qubit placement and another for routing of communications. With the help of these two algorithms the overhead of converting a logical to a physical circuit is reduced by 30.1% on an average relative to previous work. The optimization algorithms in PAQCS are evaluated on circuits implemented using quantum operations supported by two different quantum physical machine descriptions and three quantum error-correcting codes. They reduce the number of primitive operations by 11.5%-68.6% and the number of execution cycles by 16.9%-59.4%. ¬© 2015 IEEE.;

Layout Optimization for Quantum Circuits with Linear Nearest Neighbor Architectures;This paper is concerned with the physical design of quantum logic circuits. More precisely it addresses the problem of minimizing the number of required qubit reorderings (achieved by inserting explicit SWAP gates) when mapping a quantum circuit into a linear nearest neighbor quantum archi-tecture. First an interaction graph that captures the interaction distances among various qubits in the quantum circuit is constructed. The interaction graph is utilized to partition the quantum circuit into a set of subcircuits such that the number of required qubit reoderings within each subcircuit is provably no more than a given threshold. Next a Minimum Linear Arrangement problem for each subcircuit is formulated and solved to achieve the minimum number of internal qubit reorderings and determine the subcircuit input and output qubit orderings. Finally a bubble sort algorithm is repeatedly employed to minimize the number of qubit reorderings that are required between the consecutive subcircuits. Experiments done on various quantum Fourier transform circuits as well as various reversible logic circuits demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. ¬© 2016 IEEE.;

Our ideas might result in 'brain quantum-computer interfaces' as soon as quantum computers become widely available resulting in real-time apparatus. ¬© 2014 IEEE.;
A hierarchical layout generation method for quantum circuits;Quantum circuit design flow consists of two main tasks: synthesis and physical design. Synthesis converts the design description into a technology-dependent netlist and then physical design takes the fixed netlist produces the layout and schedules the netlist on the layout. Quantum physical design problem is intractable. This process can be divided into two main processes: scheduling and layout generation. Some heuristic techniques have been proposed for the layout generation. These techniques do not produce good layouts for large netlists in terms of latency. Focusing on this issue in this paper a hierarchical layout generation algorithm is proposed that generates better layouts in terms of latency. Ion trap is used as the underlying technology in this paper. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm decreases the average latency of quantum circuits by about 22% for the attempted benchmarks. ¬© 2013 IEEE.;
Counting gates moving qubits: Evaluating the execution cost of quantum circuits;Quantum algorithms can be written down in several forms one of the most common is the quantum circuit representation using discrete gates. The challenge in assessing the computational cost then becomes counting those gates with realistic costs assigned to each gate. Moreover interacting pairs of qubits inside most quantum computers will require moving qubits. In many architectures this will involve cellular automaton-like swapping of qubits. In general the depth will be described in number of quantum error correction (QEC) cycles while the total cost will be space-time ''volume'' consisting of the number of qubits involved over that set of QEC cycles. This implies that accurate estimates can be made only in the context of a particular architecture and error correction mechanism. ¬© 2012 IEEE.;
Narrowband reflective generation of higher-order optical vortices in Bragg spun optical fibers;We have studied theoretically reflecting and transmitting properties of Bragg multihelicoidal spun fibers in which refractive index distribution features l helical branches and possesses an l-fold symmetry in the transverse cross section. It is shown that for a special choice of the profile function modulation such fibers in certain spectral ranges have the property to change the topological charge of the incoming Gaussian beam in the reflected field by l units. This property could be used for narrowband generation of optical vortices (OVs) from Gaussian beams and for changing the topological charge of incoming OVs. ¬© 2013 Optical Society of America.;
Faithful quantum broadcast beyond the no-go theorem;The main superiority of the quantum remote preparation over quantum teleportation lies the classical resource saving. This situation may be changed from the following constructions. Our purpose in this paper is to find some special differences between these two quantum tasks besides the classical resource costs. Some novel schemes show that the first one is useful to simultaneously broadcast arbitrary quantum states while the second one cannot because of the quantum no-cloning theorem. Moreover these broadcast schemes may be adapted to satisfying the different receivers' requirements or distributing the classical information which are important in various quantum applications such as the quantum secret distribution or the quantum network communication. ¬© 2012 Springer Science+Business Media LLC.;
Heterotic quantum and classical computing on convergence spaces;Category-theoretic characterizations of heterotic models of computation introduced by Stepney et al. combine computational models such as classical/quantum digital/analog synchronous/asynchronous etc. to obtain increased computational power. A highly informative classical/quantum heterotic model of computation is represented by Abramsky's simple sequential imperative quantum programming language which extends the classical simple imperative programming language to encompass quantum computation. The mathematical (denotational) semantics of this classical language serves as a basic foundation upon which formal verification methods can be developed. We present a more comprehensive heterotic classical/quantum model of computation based on heterotic dynamical systems on convergence spaces. Convergence spaces subsume topological spaces but admit finer structure from which in prior work we obtained differential calculi in the cartesian closed category of convergence spaces allowing us to define heterotic dynamical systems given by coupled systems of first order differential equations whose variables are functions from the reals to convergence spaces. ¬© 2015 SPIE.;
Adiabatic quantum programming: Minor embedding with hard faults;Adiabatic quantum programming defines the time-dependent mapping of a quantum algorithm into an underlying hardware or logical fabric. An essential step is embedding problem-specific information into the quantum logical fabric. We present algorithms for embedding arbitrary instances of the adiabatic quantum optimization algorithm into a square lattice of specialized unit cells. These methods extend with fabric growth while scaling linearly in time and quadratically in footprint. We also provide methods for handling hard faults in the logical fabric without invoking approximations to the original problem and illustrate their versatility through numerical studies of embeddability versus fault rates in square lattices of complete bipartite unit cells. The studies show that these algorithms are more resilient to faulty fabrics than naive embedding approaches a feature which should prove useful in benchmarking the adiabatic quantum optimization algorithm on existing faulty hardware. ¬© 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.;

PEET: a Matlab tool for estimating physical gate errors in quantum information processing systems;A Physical Error Estimation Tool (PEET) is introduced in Matlab for predicting physical gate errors of quantum information processing (QIP) operations by constructing and then simulating gate sequences for a wide variety of user-defined Hamiltonian-based physical systems. PEET is designed to accommodate the interdisciplinary needs of quantum computing design by assessing gate performance for users familiar with the underlying physics of QIP as well as those interested in higher-level computing operations. The structure of PEET separates the bulk of the physical details of a system into Gate objects while the construction of quantum computing gate operations are contained in GateSequence objects. Gate errors are estimated by Monte Carlo sampling of noisy gate operations. The main utility of PEET though is the implementation of QuantumControl methods that act to generate and then test gate sequence and pulse-shaping techniques for QIP performance. This work details the structure of PEET and gives instructive examples for its operation. ¬© 2016 Springer Science+Business Media New York.;
All-optical switching of a single wavelength in a silicon-based ring-assisted Mach-Zehnder interferometer;We theoretically investigate for the first time an all-optical switch using a silicon-based ring-assisted Mach-Zehnder interferometer (RAMZI) where the switch mechanism relies on Raman-induced loss. Compared to the conventional standalone microring resonator (MRR) switches the RAMZI structure improves the fabrication tolerances by removing the critical coupling requirement for the MRR without compensating the switch performance. Moreover the RAMZI structure provides an improved switching speed (5 √ó faster) by shortening the photon lifetime of the MRR. Finally the inverse Raman scattering of silicon guarantees a single wavelength selectivity for the switch. ¬© 2012 Optical Society of America.;
Characterizing the performance effect of trials and rotations in applications that use Quantum Phase Estimation;Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) is one of the key techniques used in quantum computation to design quantum algorithms which can be exponentially faster than classical algorithms. Intuitively QPE allows quantum algorithms to find the hidden structure in certain kinds of problems. In particular Shor's well-known algorithm for factoring the product of two primes uses QPE. Simulation algorithms such as Ground State Estimation (GSE) for quantum chemistry also use QPE. Unfortunately QPE can be computationally expensive either requiring many trials of the computation (repetitions) or many small rotation operations on quantum bits. Selecting an efficient QPE approach requires detailed characterizations of the tradeoffs and overheads of these options. In this paper we explore three different algorithms that trade off trials versus rotations. We perform a detailed characterization of their behavior on two important quantum algorithms (Shor's and GSE). We also develop an analytical model that characterizes the behavior of a range of algorithms in this tradeoff space. ¬© 2014 IEEE.;
Quantum noise in energy-efficient slow light structures for optical computing: Sqeezed light from slow light;Due to their strong light confinement waveguides with optical nonlinearities may be a promising platform for energy-efficient optical computing. Slow light can enhance a waveguide's effective nonlinearity which could result in devices that operate in low-power regimes where quantum fluctuations are important and may also have quantum applications including squeezing and entanglement generation. In this manuscript slow-light structures based on the Kerr (œá(3)) nonlinearity are analyzed using a semi-classical model to account for the quantum noise. We develop a hybrid split-step / Runge-Kutta numerical model to compute the mean field and squeezing spectrum for pulses propagating down a waveguide and use this model to study squeezing produced in optical waveguides. Scaling relations are explored and the benefits and limitations of slow light are discussed in the context of squeezing. ¬© 2016 COPYRIGHT SPIE.;
Quantum simulation of the tunnel effect;In this paper we examine whether a quantum computer can efficiently simulate quantum processes such as the tunnel effect.

High-efficient quantum secret sharing based on the Chinese remainder theorem via the orbital angular momentum entanglement analysis;We investigate a novel quantum secret sharing (QSS) based on the Chinese remainder theory (CRT) in multi-dimensional Hilbert space with the orbital angular momentum (OAM) entanglement analysis. The secret is divided and then allotted to two or more participants who prepare pairs of photons in the OAM-entanglement states. The initial secret can be restored jointly by legal participants via the OAM-entanglement analysis on the corresponding photons. Its security is guaranteed from the OAM entanglement of photons that are established through the spin angular momentum (SAM) entanglement analysis performed on the generated SAM-based OAM hybrid entanglement photons. It provides an alternative technique for the QSS while producing the OAM entanglement photons in the combined multi-dimensional OAM Hilbert space where the CRT is conducted properly for sharing the conventional secret among legal participants. ¬© 2012 The Author(s).;
Numerical characteristics of quantum computer simulation;The simulation of quantum circuits is significantly important for the implementation of quantum information technologies. The main difficulty of such modeling is the exponential growth of dimensionality thus the usage of modern high-performance parallel computations is relevant. As it is well known arbitrary quantum computation in circuit model can be done by only single- and two-qubit gates and we analyze the computational structure and properties of the simulation of such gates. We investigate the fact that the unique properties of quantum nature lead to the computational properties of the considered algorithms: the quantum parallelism make the simulation of quantum gates highly parallel and on the other hand quantum entanglement leads to the problem of computational locality during simulation. We use the methodology of the AlgoWiki project (algowiki-project.org) to analyze the algorithm. This methodology consists of theoretical (sequential and parallel complexity macro structure and visual informational graph) and experimental (locality and memory access scalability and more specific dynamic characteristics) parts. Experimental part was made by using the petascale Lomonosov supercomputer (Moscow State University Russia). We show that the simulation of quantum gates is a good base for the research and testing of the development methods for data intense parallel software and considered methodology of the analysis can be successfully used for the improvement of the algorithms in quantum information science. ¬© 2016 SPIE..;
From q-plates to the photonic gear: Tailoring the rotational properties of light;"The rotational properties of a light beam are controlled by its spin and orbital angular momentum (SAM and OAM). The q-plate a liquid crystal device that can give rise to a coupling of these two quantities was introduced a few years ago leading to several applications in classical and quantum photonics. Very recently in particular a specific kind of q-plate was used to generate rotational-invariant states of single photons which were then employed for performing a demonstration of quantum key distribution without the need for establishing a common reference frame between the transmitting and the receiving units. This result may find applications in future satellite-based quantum communication. By a similar approach photonic states having a strongly enhanced rotational sensitivity as opposed to rotational invariance can be generated by using q-plates with very high topological charge. Photons in these states can be obtained starting from light having a uniform linear polarization and after a physical rotation can be converted back into light having uniformly linear polarization. As a result one obtains linearly polarized light whose polarization plane rotates by an angle that is proportional to the angle of physical rotation between the generation and detection stages with a very large proportionality constant. This effect of rotational amplification which we named photonic gear"" leads to a sort of ""super-resolved Malus' law"" potentially useful for measuring mechanical angles with very high precision.""";
Automatic synthesis and verification of real-time embedded software for mobile and ubiquitous systems;Introduction With the proliferation of embedded mobile and ubiquitous systems in all aspects of human life we are making greater demands on these systems including more complex functionalities such as pervasive computing mobile computing embedded computing and real-time computing. Currently the design of real-time embedded software is supported partially by modelers code generators analyzers schedulers and frameworks [1-21]. Nevertheless the technology for a completely integrated design and verification environment is still relatively immature. Furthermore the methodologies for design and for verification are also poorly integrated relying mainly on the experiences of embedded software engineers. Motivated by the above status quo this work demonstrates how the integration of software engineering techniques such as software component reuse formal software synthesis techniques such as scheduling and code generation and formal verification technique such as model checking can be realized in the form of an integrated design environment targeted at the acceleration of real-time embedded software construction. ¬© 2013 by Taylor and Francis Group LLC.;
Reconstructing a quantum state of light by means of the degree of linear polarization;In this paper authors present a novel idea for reconstructing quantum states of polarized optical field expressed in the one-photon basis. The quantum state reconstruction is a measurement of a quasidistribution function P that allows to obtain a density operator for the analyzed state. The most commonly used approach for a quantum state reconstruction is based on the so called quantum tomography. The marginal probability distributions for the Wigner function are measured for different angles of projection and then they are put together into the two-dimensional distribution by the inverse Radon transformation. In our approach the analyzed field is combined with the reference field which is well defined it can be for example a photon-beam containing linearly polarized photons only. The proposed thought experiment assumes that we measure the degree of linear polarization of this combined beam using a rotating polarizer. We obtain the searched distribution P by changing the parameters of the reference beam - its intensity and state of polarization. This series of measurements allows to build the system of equations The values of the function P at various points P(Œ∏i œÜj) are the searched variables of this system. Accuracy of that solution depends on how many measurements are done. Copyright ¬© 2012 SPIE.;
Formal verification of communication protocols using quantized Horn clauses;The stochastic nature of quantum communication protocols naturally lends itself for expression via probabilistic logic languages. In this work we describe quantized computation using Horn clauses and base the semantics on quantum probability. Turing computable Horn clauses are very convenient to work with and the formalism can be extended to general form of first order languages. Towards this end we build a Hilbert space of H-interpretations and a corresponding non commutative von Neumann algebra of bounded linear operators. We demonstrate the expressive power of the language by casting quantum communication protocols as Horn clauses. ¬© 2016 SPIE.;
Measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution with q-plate;The original measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution is reviewed and a modified protocol using rotation invariant photonic state is proposed. A hybrid encoding approach combined polarization qubit with orbit angular momentum qubit is adopted to overcome the polarization misalignment associated with random rotations in long-distance quantum key distribution. The initial encoding and final decoding of information in our MDI-QKD implementation protocol can be conveniently performed in the polarization space while the transmission is done in the rotation invariant hybrid space. Our analysis indicates that both the secure key rate and transmission distance can be improved with our modified protocol owing to the lower quantum bit error rate. Furthermore our hybrid encoding approach only needs to insert four q-plates in practical experiment and to overcome the polarization misalignment problem mentioned above without including any feedback control. ¬© 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York.;

Distributed Photonic Quantum Computations Assisted by Atomic Ensembles;Distributed quantum computation requires that quantum operations may be acted on remote logical qubits. We investigate the possibility of the distributed quantum computation for nonlocal photons assisted by cavity quantum electrodynamics. We first give a compact circuit for the controlled-NOT gate on a remote two-photon system. For the Toffoli gate we introduce two circuits for a bipartite system with one photonic Einstein-Podolski-Rosen (EPR) entanglement. Two EPR pairs are required for a tripartite system. These Toffoli gates cost a half of entanglements required in the previous teleportation-based quantum computation. These elementary gates may be combined flexibly up to special decompositions of joint system in large-scale quantum applications. ¬© 2016 IEEE.;
Quantum lattice gas algorithmic representation of gauge field theory;Presented is a quantum lattice gas algorithm to efficiently model a system of Dirac particles interacting through an intermediary gauge field. The algorithm uses a fixed qubit array to represent both the spacetime and the particles contained in the spacetime. Despite being a lattice based algorithm Lorentz invariance is preserved down to the grid scale with the continuum Dirac Hamiltonian generating the local unitary evolution even at that scale: there is nonlinear scaling between the smallest observable time and that time measured in the quantum field theory limit a kind of time dilation effect that emerges on small scales but has no effect on large scales. The quantum lattice gas algorithm correctly accounts for the anticommutative braiding of indistinguishable fermions|it does not suffer the Fermi-sign problem. It provides a highly convergent numerical simulation for strongly-correlated fermions equal to a covariant path integral presented here for the case when a Dirac particle's Compton wavelength is large compared to the grid scale of the qubit array. ¬© 2016 SPIE.;

And then a more in-depth analysis on the research progress design idea and substantive characteristics of corresponding QPC categories is carried out respectively. Finally the applications of QPC and quantum secure multi-party computation issues are discussed and in addition three possible research mainstream directions are pointed out.;
Modeling of the whispering gallery mode in microdisk and microgear resonators using a toeplitz matrix formalism for single-photon source;The work presented in this paper develops a new formalism to design microdisks and microgears structures. The main objective is to study the optics and geometrics parameters influence on the microdisks and microgears structures resonance behavior. This study is conducted to choice a resonance structure with height quality factor Q to be associated with Quantum dot to form a single photon source. This new method aims to design resonant structures that are simpler and requires less computing performances than FDTD and Floquet Block methods. This formalism is based on simplifying Fourier transformed and using toeplitz matrix writing. This new writing allows designing all kind of resonance structures with any defect and any modification. In other study we have design a quantum dot emitting a photon at 1550 nm of the fundamental mode but the quantum dot emits other photons at other wavelengths. The focus of the resonant structure and the quantum dot association is the resonance of the photon at 1550 nm and the elimination of all other photons with others energies. The quantum dot studied in [1] is an InAs/GaAs quantum dot we design an GaAS microdisk and microgear and we compare the quality factor Q of this two structures and we conclude that the microgear is more appropriated to be associate to the quantum dot and increase the probability P1 to obtain a single photon source at 1550 nm and promotes the obtaining of single photon. The performance improving of the resonant structure is able to increase the success of quantum applications such as quantum gates based on single photon source. ¬© 2013 SPIE.;
Addition and subtraction operation of optical orbital angular momentum with dielectric metasurfaces;In this work we propose a simple approach to realize addition and subtraction operation of optical orbital angular momentum (OAM) based on dielectric metasurfaces. The spin-orbit interaction of light in spatially inhomogeneous and anisotropic metasurfaces results in the spin-to-orbital angular momentum conversion. The subtraction system of OAM consists of two cascaded metasurfaces while the addition system of OAM is constituted by inserting a half waveplate (HWP) between the two metasurfaces. Our experimental results are in good agreement with the theoretical calculation. These results could be useful for OAM-carrying beams applied in optical communication information processing etc. ¬© 2015 Elsevier B.V.;
Formation of propagation invariant laser beams with anamorphic optical systems;Propagation invariant structured laser beams play an important role in several photonics applications. A majority of propagation invariant beams are usually produced in the form of laser modes emanating from stable laser cavities. This work shows that anamorphic optical systems can be effectively employed to transform input propagation invariant laser beams and produce a variety of alternative propagation invariant structured laser beam distributions with different shapes and phase structures. This work also presents several types of anamorphic lens systems suitable for transforming the input laser modes into a variety of structured propagation invariant beams. The transformations are applied to different laser mode types including Hermite-Gaussian Laguerre-Gaussian and Ince-Gaussian field distributions. The influence of the relative azimuthal orientation between the input laser modes and the anamorphic optical systems on the resulting transformed propagation invariant beams is presented as well. ¬© 2015 SPIE.;
Enhanced and heralded single-photon source models for quantum applications;In this work we address a comparison study between two kinds of Single Photon Sources (SPS). The first SPS is an Enhanced SPS (ESPS) which consists of an association between InAs/GaAs Quantum Dot (QD) and photonic crystal (PC) microcavity. The ESPS emits a single photon at 1550 nm with probability P1 around 0.7. The second SPS is the Heralded SPS (HSPS) and based on active two-dimensional PC over LiNbO3 and emits photons at 1310 nm and 1550nm. The photon at 1310 nm triggers the detection mechanism of the photon at 1550nm. The probability to obtain a HSPS at 1550 nm is closed to 0.57. Finally we present a comparison study between ESPS and HSPS when they are used in an application of quantum communication. ¬© 2015 SPIE.;

Controllability of dynamical systems. A survey;The main objective of this article is to review the major progress that has been made on controllability of dynamical systems over the past number of years. Controllability is one of the fundamental concepts in the mathematical control theory. This is a qualitative property of dynamical control systems and is of particular importance in control theory. A systematic study of controllability was started at the beginning of sixties in the last century when the theory of controllability based on the description in the form of state space for both time-invariant and time-varying linear control systems was worked out. Roughly speaking controllability generally means that it is possible to steer a dynamical control system from an arbitrary initial state to an arbitrary final state using the set of admissible controls. It should be mentioned that in the literature there are many different definitions of controllability which strongly depend on a class of dynamical control systems and on the other hand on the form of admissible controls. Controllability problems for different types of dynamical systems require the application of numerous mathematical concepts and methods taken directly from differential geometry functional analysis topology matrix analysis and theory of ordinary and partial differential equations and theory of difference equations. In the paper we use mainly state-space models of dynamical systems which provide a robust and universal method for studying controllability of various classes of systems. Controllability plays an essential role in the development of modern mathematical control theory. There are various important relationships between controllability stability and stabilizability of linear both finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional control systems. Controllability is also strongly related to the theory of realization and so called minimal realization and canonical forms for linear time-invariant control systems such as the Kalmam canonical form the Jordan canonical form or the Luenberger canonical form. It should be mentioned that for many dynamical systems there exists a formal duality between the concepts of controllability and observability. Moreover controllability is strongly connected with the minimum energy control problem for many classes of linear finite dimensional infinite dimensional dynamical systems and delayed systems both deterministic and stochastic. Finally it is well known that controllability concept has many important applications not only in control theory and systems theory but also in such areas as industrial and chemical process control reactor control control of electric bulk power systems aerospce engineering and recently in quantum systems theory.;

The efficient sorting of light's orbital angular momentum for optical communications;We have developed a mode transformer comprising two custom refractive optical elements which convert orbital angular momentum states into transverse momentum states. This transformation efficiently measures the orbital angular momentum content of an input light beam allowing the decoding of OAM states within a free-space communications channel. Turbulence is a key issue within such a channel. Through the use of a phase only spatial light modulator turbulence is simulated and the cross talk between detected OAM modes is observed. We study this crosstalk for eleven OAM modes showing that turbulence equally degrades the purity of all the modes within this range. ¬© 2012 SPIE.;
Quantum memory based on phase matching control;We discuss a class of quantum memory (QM) scheme based on phase matching control (PMC). A single-photon wave packet can be mapped into and retrieved on demand from a long-lived spin grating in the presence of a control field forming along with the signal field a Raman configuration when the wave vector of the control field is continuously changed in time. Such mapping and retrieval takes place due to the phase matching condition and requires neither a variation of the amplitude of the control field nor inhomogeneous broadening of the medium. We discuss the general model of PMC QM and its specific implementation via (i) modulation of the refractive index (ii) angular scanning of the control field and (iii) its frequency chirp. We show that the performance of the PMC QM protocol may be as good as those realized in the gradient echo memory (GEM) but achieved with less stringent requirements on the medium. We suggest the experimental realization of PMC QM in nitrogen vacancies (NV) and silicon vacancies (SiV) in diamond as well as in rare-earth doped crystals. ¬© 2014 Astro Ltd.;
A quantum physical design flow using ILP and graph drawing;Implementing large-scale quantum circuits is one of the challenges of quantum computing. One of the central challenges of accurately modeling the architecture of these circuits is to schedule a quantum application and generate the layout while taking into account the cost of communications and classical resources as well as the maximum exploitable parallelism. In this paper we present and evaluate a design flow for arbitrary quantum circuits in ion trap technology. Our design flow consists of two parts. First a scheduler takes a description of a circuit and finds the best order for the execution of its quantum gates using integer linear programming regarding the classical resources (qubits) and instruction dependencies. Then a layout generator receives the schedule produced by the scheduler and generates a layout for this circuit using a graph-drawing algorithm. Our experimental results show that the proposed flow decreases the average latency of quantum circuits by about 11 % for a set of attempted benchmarks and by about 9 % for another set of benchmarks compared with the best in literature. ¬© 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.;
Manipulation of the nuclear spin ensemble in a quantum dot with chirped magnetic resonance pulses;The nuclear spins in nanostructured semiconductors play a central role in quantum applications. The nuclear spins represent a useful resource for generating local magnetic fields but nuclear spin noise represents a major source of dephasing for spin qubits. Controlling the nuclear spins enhances the resource while suppressing the noise. NMR techniques are challenging: the group III and V isotopes have large spins with widely different gyromagnetic ratios in strained material there are large atom-dependent quadrupole shifts and nanoscale NMR is hard to detect. We report NMR on 100000 nuclear spins of a quantum dot using chirped radiofrequency pulses. Following polarization we demonstrate a reversal of the nuclear spin. We can flip the nuclear spin back and forth a hundred times. We demonstrate that chirped NMR is a powerful way of determining the chemical composition the initial nuclear spin temperatures and quadrupole frequency distributions for all the main isotopes. The key observation is a plateau in the NMR signal as a function of sweep rate: we achieve inversion at the first quantum transition for all isotopes simultaneously. These experiments represent a generic technique for manipulating nanoscale inhomogeneous nuclear spin ensembles and open the way to probe the coherence of such mesoscopic systems. ¬© 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

An MINLP model for scheduling and placement of quantum circuits with a heuristic solution approach;Recent works on quantum physical design have pushed the scheduling and placement of quantum circuit into their prominent positions. In this article a mixed integer nonlinear programming model is proposed for the placement and scheduling of quantum circuits in such a way that latency is minimized. The proposed model determines locations of gates and the sequence of operations. The proposed model is proved reducible to a quadratic assignment problem which is a well-known NP-complete combinatorial optimization problem. Since it is impossible to find the optimal solution of this NP-complete problem for large quantum circuits within a reasonable amount of time a metaheuristic solution method is developed for the proposed model. Some experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the developed solution approach. Experimental results show that the proposed approach improves average latency by about 24.09% for the attempted benchmarks. ¬© 2015 ACM.;
Notes on deterministic programming of quantum observables and channels;We study the limitations of deterministic programmability of quantum circuits e.g. quantum computer. More precisely we analyze the programming of quantum observables and channels via quantum multimeters. We show that the programming vectors for any two different sharp observables are necessarily orthogonal whenever post-processing is not allowed. This result then directly implies that also any two different unitary channels require orthogonal programming vectors. This approach generalizes the well-known orthogonality result first proven by Nielsen and Chuang. In addition we give size bounds for a multimeter to be efficient in quantum programming. ¬© 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York.;
Mechanical effects of light on material media: Radiation pressure and the linear and angular momenta of photons;Electromagnetic waves carry energy as well as linear and angular momenta. Interactions between light and material media typically involve the exchange of all three entities. In all such interactions energy and momentum (both linear and angular) are conserved. Johannes Kepler seems to have been the first person to notice that the pressure of sunlight is responsible for the tails of the comets pointing away from the Sun. Modern applications of radiation pressure and photon momentum include solar sails optical tweezers for optical trapping and micro-manipulation and optically-driven micro-motors and actuators. This paper briefly describes certain fundamental aspects underlying the mechanical properties of light and examines several interesting phenomena involving the linear and angular momenta of photons. ¬© 2014 SPIE.;

Research on time petri net oriented UML statechart and its application;In view of the UML statechart's shortage and Time Petri nets' merit in real-time application we propose an approach transforming the timing constraint UML statechart model to the Time Petri net model. Firstly on the basis of our previous study on UML statechart with time extension we provide the formal description of that kind of UML statechart to achieve its formalizing. By analyzing it and the formal semantics of Time Petri net we propose the approach for automatic transformation and analysis of time characteristics of statechart. Finally we take a safety-critical system the distributed railway interlocking system (DRIS) as a study case. The study result shows that with our approach the design model of a safe route's establishment is reliable what is more the time information in interlocking logic and the single state's contribution to the whole process get clearly reflected which helps to promote the design quality. ¬© 2015 ICIC International.;
Hierarchical state machines for native mobile apps;The primary goal of this paper is to present a simple and efficient implementation of the Hierarchical State Machine (HSM) design pattern for native mobile applications. By providing easy-to-use C language recipes for generating HSMs the proposed implementation techniques are valuable in that they raise the level of abstraction and allow for straightforward mapping of UML state charts to compact and efficient code in C language. Writing interactive software for embedded systems leads many issues due to the lack of adapted control structures to a code that is difficult to maintain and reuse. Formalisms adapted to the description and to the specification of interactions do exist. We propose to extend imperative programming languages with a control structure borrowed from one of those formalisms: the hierarchical state machines. ¬© 2012 IEEE.;
Generations of N-atom GHZ state and 2n-atom W state assisted by quantum dots in optical microcavities;Multipartite entangled state plays a crucial role in quantum applications. We propose theoretical schemes to generate entanglements among several trapped atoms with the help of quantum dots in single-side optical microcavities. In the first scheme a basic architecture will be built to produce arbitrary N-atom GHZ state by using only one auxiliary photon. Moreover using a photon state with multiple modes we can realize 2n-atom W state. All these schemes are insensitive to the variation of the atom‚Äìphoton coupling rates and are also right for remotely trapped atoms by using the photonic transmissions local quantum operations and classical channel. Simulations show that our schemes are faithful and available with present physical techniques. ¬© 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York.;

Synthesizing a specification-based monitor for safety requirements;Safety-critical systems such as medical and avionic ones are the systems in which failure to satisfy the user requirements may put man's life and resources in jeopardy. Since the adequate reliability of the software of such systems may be unobtainable via formal methods and the software testing approach single-handedly verification of run-time behavior of software against user requirements violation is considered as a complementary approach. However the synthesis of such a run-time verifier hereafter we have called it a monitor is confronted with the challenging problem of verifying low-level run-time behavior of target software against high-level user requirements violation. To solve this problem we propose an approach in two phases. In the first phase we obtain user requirements and then specify their violation formally. This formal specification is a high-level version of user requirements violations and should be mapped to a low-level one. To this end in the second phase we extract a tabular automaton from the formal specification of user requirements violations in order to determine a state-based specification of the violations. This low-level specification which constitutes the core of the monitor determines those states which target software should not reach. To show the effectiveness of our approach we apply it to the synthesis of a monitor for verifying behavior of the Continuous Insulin Infusion Pump (CIIP) system. ¬© Shiraz University.;

Interaction-free quantum optical fredkin gates in œá (2) Microdisks;We present novel interaction-free realizations of quantum optical Fredkin gates that do not rely on direct physical coupling between the target light (signal) and the control light (pump). The interaction-free feature of such gates allow to overcome the fundamental limits of photon loss and quantum-state decoherence imposed by the signal-pump coupling. This advantage together with the low inherent quantum-noise level in œá (2) microdisks gives rise to substantially improved performance over the existing Fredkin-gate designs. Explicitly using lithium-niobate mircrodisks we present two kinds of interaction-free Fredkin gates a phase gate and an optical-path gate both of which are designed with telecom-band applications in mind. For both gates the threshold pump peak power to achieve a gate contrast >100 and a signal loss <10% is hundreds of microwatts for practical parameters of the devices. ¬© 2011 IEEE.;
Spin-to-orbital angular momentum exchange via reflection from a cone;In a recent paper we explored the novel reflection properties of several conical optical elements using numerical simulations based on Maxwell's equations. For example in the case of a hollow metallic cone having an apex angle of 90¬∞ a circularly-polarized incident beam acquires upon reflection the opposite spin angular momentum in addition to an orbital angular momentum twice as large as the spin whereas a 90¬∞ cone made of a transparent material in which the incident light suffers two total internal reflections before returning may be designed to endow the retro-reflected beam with different mixtures of orbital and spin angular momenta. In the present paper we introduce an approximate analysis based on the Jones calculus to elucidate the physics underlying the reflection properties and we point to the strengths and weaknesses of the approach. ¬© 2011 SPIE.;
Parallel quantum computer simulation on the GPU;Simulation of quantum computers using classical computers is a hard problem with high memory and computational requirements. Parallelization can alleviate this problem allowing the simulation of more qubits at the same time or the same number of qubits to be simulated in less time. A promising approach is to exploit the high performance computing capabilities provided by the latest graphical processing units. In this paper we present a parallel implementation of the QC-lib quantum computer simulator on the GPU using the CUDA programming model. The proposed scheme for partitioning the terms that describe the state of a quantum register takes advantage of the specific characteristics of the CUDA memory spaces and allows for an efficient parallelization of the general singe qubit operator. Experimental results indicate that very good speed-ups can be obtained in contrast with the sequential implementation. ¬© 2011 Faculty of Auto Control.;
Equivalence of the hawking temperature in conformal frames;The conformal invariance of the Hawking temperature conjectured for the asymptotically flat and stationary black holes by Jacobson and Kang is semiclassically evaluated for a simple particular case of symmetrical spherically and non-asymptotically flat black hole. By using the Bogoliubov coefficients the metric euclideanization the reflection coefficient and the gravitational anomaly as methods of calculating the Hawking temperature we find that it is invariant under a specific conformal transformation of the metric. We briefly discuss the results for each method. ¬© Springer-Verlag / Societ√† Italiana di Fisica 2012.;
Separation of concerns on the orchestration of operations in flexible manufacturing;Purpose - The growing complexity of industrial robot work-cells calls for the use of advanced orchestration techniques to promote flexibility and reusability. This paper aims to present a solution based on service-oriented platforms that endorses the separation of concerns coordination and execution. Design/methodology/approach - This paper starts with the evaluation of available tools for the orchestration and service generation. Endorsing the missing features depicted in that evaluation the paper describes developments of concepts and software and the evaluation made. Findings - From the early evaluations made in this paper the SCXML-based purposed language is more adapted to the industrial robotic cell scenario than existing alternatives. The generation of services allow the integration without knowledge from any programming language. Practical implications - This approach's main drawback as described by some users was the lack of some programming features: simple math operations and conditional statements. Originality/value - This paper fulfils two partially unsolved problems: adequate languages for orchestration of service oriented on the device level and purposes techniques for the specification of services using robot programming languages. ¬© 2012 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Spectral manipulation of optical pulses using the gradient echo memory scheme;The burgeoning fields of quantum computing and quantum key distribution have created a demand for a quantum memory. The gradient echo memory (GEM) is one such scheme that can boast efficiencies approaching unity. Here we investigate the ability of GEM to spectrally manipulate light pulses stored in the memory. Spectral manipulation is important for pulse compression sideband extraction and matching of pulse spectra to resonant and spectroscopic systems as well as the potential to increase qubit rates in quantum communications networks. We present both theoretical and experimental results demonstrating the ability to shift the frequency as well as spectrally compress or expand a pulse. Also the ability of GEM to recall different frequency components of a pulse at different times and interfere two initially time separated pulses that are stored in the memory are shown. ¬© 2011 IEEE.;

A higher order Poincare sphere representation;A recently proposed higher order Poincare sphere constructed from the total optical angular momentum eigenstates of circular polarized optical vortices and the higher order states of polarization of vector vortex beams is presented. This novel representation can be applied to facilitate the description of various vector polarization beams such as radial and azimuthally polarized cylindrical vector beams as well as the spin orbit conversion of q-plates. An experimental method with which to measure higher order Stokes parameters in terms of a spin and orbital decomposition of a light beam is also discussed. ¬© 2012 Copyright Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).;
Transfer from arbitrary pure state to target mixed state for quantum systems;Considering two-level quantum systems this paper proposes a control strategy that drives an arbitrary pure state to target mixed state via three-step controls. The first step is the preparation of eigenstate: the state of system controlled is driven to eigenstate from an arbitrary pure state. The second one is to drive the eigenstate prepared to the mixed state in which not all of the off-diagonal elements in the density matrices are zeros. In this step one needs to use an auxiliary system and achieves the transfer through the interaction between controlled system and auxiliary system. If the target state is the mixed state in which all of the off-diagonal elements in the density matrices are zeros then one needs to perform the third step: to drive the mixed state obtained in the second step to the target mixed state. Numerical simulation experiments and results analysis are given. The control strategy proposed in this paper is useful in the application of quantum computation. ¬© 2011 IFAC.;
Applications of two-photon processes in semiconductor photonic devices: Invited review;Semiconductor photonics is an advanced field both from fundamental and applicative points of view aimed at the integration of the unique features of optical communications and quantum optics with the miniaturization and controllability of semiconductors. Many classical and quantum applications may benefit from interaction between optical signals usually implemented by nonlinear optical processes of various orders. The efficiency of such processes in semiconductors is being constantly enhanced assisted by the progress in ultrashort laser pulses and ultra-sensitive detectors enabling practical devices. In this review the lowest order of nonlinear interactions - the two-photon processes in semiconductors - are discussed and their applications to a variety of novel classical and quantum configurations are reviewed. ¬© 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.;
Applying event-based framework to support power system integration;This paper describes a real life integration scenario of two power control systems. For that purpose we designed event-based framework and use it to create soft-real time gateway application service that facilitate integration of two complex event-driven distributed systems. The event-based framework uses publish-subscribe event delivery and supports asynchronous messaging including asynchronous transactions. Extensible event-driven applications can be based on that framework. Event listeners and event type subscriptions could be added or removed at runtime. The framework simplifies application design and implementation because it solves concurrency related issues and access to shared resources by design-application developer does not need to deal with multithreading at all and still can implement flexible multithreaded thread-safe event-driven applications. ¬© 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.;
Timed and Resource-oriented Statecharts for embedded software;Embedded software should be correctly developed so that it is be compliant with not only functional requirements but also real-time and resource constraints. However those constraints are often dependent on execution environments that are sometimes revealed in late development phases. In this paper we propose Timed and Resource-oriented Statecharts (TRoS) to analyze the time and resource-constrained behavior of system in earlier development phases of embedded software development. TRoS extends Statecharts using timed action labeled with resources to represent actions that consume resources. This enables us to describe the competition among processes to use shared resources and to analyze schedulability of embedded systems. We present a case study of a distance control module that controls train movement to keep the distance between trains for railway control systems. ¬© 2010 IEEE.;
Generation of optical vortices in spun multihelicoidal optical fibers;We have theoretically studied long-period spun l-helicoidal fibers and their ability to generate singular beams from regular ones. On the basis of perturbation theory in the presence of degeneracy applied to the scalar waveguide equation we obtained the structure of coupled modes of such fibers and their spectra. It is shown that the coupled modes consist of the fields which taken separately bear topological charges that differby l units. We have numerically studied the process of the passage of a Gaussian beam through such a fiber and demonstrated that long-period l-helicoidal fibers have the ability to change - in a certain wavelength range - the topological charge of the incoming Gaussian beam by l units generating in this way charge-l optical vortex. ¬© 2012 Optical Society of America.;
Coherent control of light pulses stored in a Gradient Echo Memory;We address the problem of storage and retrieval of a time-bin qubit onto an atomic ensemble of three-level atoms of the Œõ - type driven by a far detuned coupling field. The atoms are subject to a longitudinal magnetic field which produces a spatially varying Zeeman splitting of the lower levels along the medium and allows for the spatial encoding of the different angular frequencies of the input pulse during the storage phase. The system operates like a quantum optical memory which is referred to as Gradient Echo Memory (GEM) in analogy to the NMR gradient echo. In the conventional approach to GEM-based devices in Œõ - type media the coupling field co-propagates with the probe field and the magnetic field is reversed after the storage phase thus an echo signal is released from the medium in the forward direction in contrast to œÄ-pulse based echo memories which produce a time reversed echo signal in the backward direction. In this work we predict that a backward echo pulse can also be obtained in a GEM schema by making use of a counter-propagating coupling field during the reading phase of the process. In addition we show that for a proper engineering of the control parameters the system can act as an optical router i.e. part of the stored signal can be released in the forward direction and the rest in the backward one. The current proposal could have potential applications in quantum information processing. ¬© 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;
A special issue on technology trends and theory of nanoscale devices for quantum applications;Electromagnetic waves carry energy linear momentum and angular momentum. When light (or other electromagnetic radiation) interacts with material media both energy and momentum are usually exchanged. The force and torque experienced by material bodies in their interactions with the electromagnetic field are such that the energy as well as the linear and angular momenta of the overall system (i.e. the system of field plus matter) are conserved. Radiation forces are now used routinely to trap and manipulate small objects such as glass or plastic micro-beads and biological cells to drive micro- and nanomachines and to contemplate interstellar travel with the aid of solar sails. We discuss the properties of the electromagnetic field that enable such wide-ranging applications. ¬© 2011 Copyright Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).;
Gradient echo memory in a tripod-like dense atomic medium;We analyze the storage and retrieval of a weak light pulse having two orthogonally (circularly) polarized components onto an atomic ensemble of four-level atoms of the tripod type driven by a far detuned coupling field. The atoms are subject to a longitudinal magnetic field which produces a spatially varying Zeeman splitting of the lower levels along the medium and allows for a spatial encoding of the different angular frequencies of the input pulse during the storage phase. A single reversion of the external magnetic field results in a rephasing of the dipoles and leads to the release of the stored signals. The shape of the recovered pulse is a time-reversal copy of the input pulse. The application of an additional reversion of the magnetic field during the storage phase allows the release of a copy of the input pulse without time reversal. We also show that the system may operate like an all-optical multiplexer when considering two impinging optical fields which have orthogonal components. The proposal has potential applications in quantum information processing. ¬© 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;
From applications to models and to embedded system code: A modeling approach in action;"Embedded systems are becoming more and more popular in current digital era.

Collective dynamic and static blockade mechanisms are proposed for realization of $\sqrt {iSWAP;
Design and implementation of a quantum compiler;We present a compiler for programming quantum architectures based on the Quantum Random Access Machine (QRAM) model.

Reusable state machine components for embedded control systems;The paper presents a software design method for embedded applications featuring reconfigurable components such as a State Machine (SM) function block operating in conjunction with a composite Signal Generator (SG) function block. The method emphasizes separation of concerns whereby the State Machine realizes the reactive aspect of system behaviour in separation from the transformational aspect which is delegated to the Signal Generator. Instances of these function blocks can be used to configure event-driven state machines executed periodically in the context of control system tasks (actors). When activated the SM determines the control step that has to be executed in response to a particular event. The control step is then indicated to the SG which generates the corresponding control signals. The SM has been implemented using a new Binary Decision Diagram (BDD)-based design pattern resulting in a simple yet powerful component capable of processing both discrete and continuous signals which can be used to efficiently implement control actors for sequential and hybrid control applications.;

Nanodiamonds;Some of the biological and quantum applications of nanodiamonds and the central role of diamond color centers are discussed. The application of diamond to quantum and biological technologies can be significantly used through the negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy center (NV). NV in nanodiamond can be created by three ways including forming NV during the diamond growth process activating N present in the diamond as an impurity and implanting nitrogen into ultra-pure (low-nitrogen) diamond. Each method has its own advantages and the choice of the fabrication methodology ultimately depends on the desired application. Nanodiamonds represent the most convenient controllable room-temperature quantum entity. Researchers around the world are incorporating nanodiamond NV in applications such as quantum key distribution quantum-limited sensing and biomarking. The use of nanodiamonds rather than bulk single crystal allows for a better collection efficiency of the photons.;
A lattice Boltzmann model for the reaction-diffusion equations with higher-order accuracy;"In this paper a lattice Boltzmann model based on the higher-order moment method for the reaction-diffusion equations is proposed. In order to obtain higher-order accuracy of truncation error and to overcome the drawbacks of error rebound"" in the previous models a new assumption of additional distribution is presented. As results the reaction-diffusion equations are recovered with the fourth-order accuracy of truncation error. Based on this model the Fitzhugh-Nagumo equations are simulated. The comparisons between the LBM results and the Alternative Direction Implicit (ADI) results are given in detail. The numerical examples show that the higher-order moment method can be used to raise the accuracy of the truncation error of the lattice Boltzmann scheme for the reaction-diffusion equations. ¬© 2011 Springer Science+Business Media LLC.""";
The sonic screwdriver: A model system for study of wave angular momentum;"When samples of interest are small enough even the relatively weak forces and torques associated with light can be sufficient for mechanical manipulation can offer extraordinary position control and can measure interactions with resolution three orders of magnitude better than atomic force microscopy. However as the components of interest grow to slightly larger length scales (which may yet be of interest for microfluidic lab-on-a-chip"" technologies and for research involving biomedical imaging) other approaches gain strength. This paper includes discussion of the angular momentum carried by sonic beams that we have implemented both to levitate and controllably rotate disks as large as four inches across. Discussion of such acoustic beams complements the discussion of the angular momentum carried by light and by further analogy how we view stationary states discussed in quantum mechanics. Hence a primary use of the sonic screwdriver is as a model system although these beams are useful for a variety of other reasons as well (not least of which is aberration correction for ultrasonic array systems). Methods including the use of holographically structured fields are discussed. ¬© 2011 SPIE.""";

Quantum physical synthesis: Improving physical design by netlist modifications;Quantum circuit design flow consists of two main tasks: synthesis and physical design. In the current flows two procedures are performed subsequently and without any information sharing between two processes that can limit the optimization of the quantum circuit metrics synthesis converts the design description into a technology-dependent netlist and then physical design takes the fixed netlist produces the layout and schedules the netlist on the layout. To address the limitations imposed on optimization of the quantum circuit objectives because of no information sharing between synthesis and physical design processes in this paper we introduce physical synthesis concept in quantum circuits to improve the objectives by manipulating layout or netlist locally considering layout information. We propose a technique for physical synthesis in quantum circuits using gate-exchanging heuristic to improve the latency of quantum circuits. Moreover a physical design flow enhanced by the technique is proposed. Our experimental results show that the proposed physical design flow empowered by the gate exchanging technique decreases the average latency objective of quantum circuits by about 24% for the attempted benchmarks. ¬© 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
